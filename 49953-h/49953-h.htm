<p>Many a smiling plain, many a wooded slope and sequestered
valley adorns the fair province of Picardy. Nor
is it without reason that her Norman-looking sons and handsome
daughters are proud of their birth-place; but the most
prejudiced of them will hardly be found to affirm that her
seaboard is either picturesque or interesting; and perhaps the
strictest search would fail to discover a duller town than
Calais in the whole bounds of France. With the gloom of
night settling down upon the long low line of white sand
which stretches westward from the harbour, and an angry
surge rising on the adjacent shoal, while out to seaward darkness
is brooding over the face of the deep, an unwilling
traveller might, indeed, be induced to turn into the narrow
ill-paved streets of the town, on the seaman-like principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
running for any port in a storm; but it would be from the
sheer necessity of procuring food and lodging, not from any
delusive expectation of gaiety and amusement, essential ingredients
in a Frenchman’s every-day life. And yet Calais
has been the scene of many a thrilling incident and stirring
event. Could they speak, those old houses, with their pointed
gables, their overhanging roofs, and quaint diamond-paned
windows, they could tell some strange tales of love and war,
of French and English chivalry, of deeds of arms performed
for the sake of honour, and beauty, and ambition, and gold&mdash;the
four strings on which most of the tunes are played that
speed the Dance of Death&mdash;of failures and successes, hopes
and disappointments, the ups and downs, the ins and outs,
the cross-purposes, the hide-and-seek, that constitute the game
of life. In that very house, over the way yonder&mdash;with its
silent courtyard, in which the grass shoots up vigorously
between the stones, and from which to-day nothing more unusual
issues than an old peasant woman in a clean cap, carrying
a young child with a dirty face&mdash;slept, perhaps, the loveliest
woman the world ever saw, a widow, while yet a bride, a
queen while yet a child, on her way from one royal throne
to take possession of another. Yes, here she lay the night
before she quitted her dear France, never to see it again; the
bright, the beautiful, the beloved, a very rose amongst all the
flowers of the garden, a very gem amongst all the gold and
tinsel that surrounded her, the link in a line of kings, the
pride of two countries, the fairest of God’s creatures&mdash;Mary,
Queen of Scots&mdash;here she lay, with life and love and hope
before her, and slept, and dreamed not of Fotheringay.</p>

<p>It was a chill autumn night. Beyond the walls a rising
breeze moaned fitfully over the dreary flats. The ebbing tide
murmured as it receded, returning, and yet returning, as
though loth to leave that comfortless expanse of wet level
sand. A few drops of rain fell from time to time, and
though a star struggled out here and there, the sky became
momentarily more obscured. It was a gloomy night out at
sea yonder; it was a gloomy night here on shore, dismal, foreboding,
and suggestive of farewell.</p>

<p>But within the town, bustle and hurry, and a certain amount
of confusion, not unmixed with revelry, imparted considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
life and animation to the hours of darkness, scaring indeed
some of the quiet householders, and rousing the echoes in the
narrow streets. Horses, picketed in the market-place, stamped
and snorted and shook their bridles; spurs clanked on the
pavement; steel corslet and head-piece flashed in the light of
torches held by bearded men-at-arms, looking doubly martial
in that red glare. Here might be seen a dainty page in satin
doublet, with velvet cap and feather, elbowing some sturdy
groom who was bearing a cuirass home from the armourer’s,
or leading a charger to its stall, and inquiring, with all a
page’s freedom, for the lodging of his lord, to receive, probably,
an answer neither respectful nor explanatory, but productive
of a stinging retort&mdash;for in those days the pages of a great
house were masters of all weapons, but especially of the tongue.
There might be observed a group of peasant-women, in clean
hoods and aprons, with baskets on their heads, lingering
somewhat longer than was absolutely necessary to exchange
with harquebusiers or spearmen those compliments in which
the French imagination is so prolific, and which the French
language renders with such graceful facility. Anon, a lord of
high degree, easily recognised by the dignity of his bearing,
and the number of his retainers thronging round him with
arms and torches, passed along the streets, exciting the curiosity
of the vulgar and the admiration of the softer sex; while
more than one churchman, threading his way quietly homeward,
dropped his ‘<i>Benedicite</i>’ with gentle impartiality
amongst the throng. The blessing was usually received with
gratitude, though an exception might occur in the person of
some stalwart man-at-arms, large of limb, fresh-coloured, and
fair-bearded, who returned the good man’s greeting with
derision or contempt. These reprobates were invariably well
armed, and extremely soldier-like in their bearing, to be distinguished,
moreover, by their blue velvet surcoats, on which
St Andrew’s cross was embroidered in silver, and the peculiar
form of their steel-lined bonnets, which they wore with a
jaunty air on one side the head. Something, also, of more
than the usual assumption of a soldier might be traced in their
demeanour, as is apt to be the case with the members of a
<i>corps d’élite</i>, and such the Archers of the Scottish Body-Guard
had indeed a right to be considered both by friend and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
foe. Although in the service of His Most Catholic Majesty,
many of them, including their captain, the unfortunate Earl
of Arran, were staunch Protestants; and at that rancorous
period, the supporters of the Reformed Church did by no
means confine themselves to a silent abnegation of the errors
they had renounced.</p>

<p>One archer, however, a young man with nothing peculiarly
striking either in face or figure, save an air of frankness and
quiet determination on his sun-burnt brow, acknowledged
the benediction of a passing ecclesiastic with a humility that
excited the jeers of two or three comrades, to which he
replied with the quiet simplicity that seemed to be a part of
his character, ‘An old man’s blessing, lads, can do neither
you nor me any harm,’ and proceeded on his way without
further remark or explanation; while the manner in which
his rebuke was received by the scorners themselves, denoted
that he was at least a person of some consideration and
standing in the <i>corps</i>. Elbowing his way through a gaudy
crowd, consisting of the Marquis d’Elbœuf’s retainers, who
were accompanying their master in his attendance on his
royal niece, and certain satellites of the House of Guise, for
the duke and duchess, with Cardinal Lorraine, had already
escorted the Queen of Scotland thus far upon her journey,
our archer turned into an <i>auberge</i>, already filled with a
mixture of courtiers, soldiers, pages, men-at-arms, and other
officials, and seating himself at a small deal table, coarse and
clean, requested to be served, in a tone of impatience that
implied a vigorous appetite and a long fast. While the host,
quick, courteous and smiling, bustled up to him, with napkin,
trencher, and some two feet of bread, the archer removed
the bonnet from his brow, and, looking around him, nodded
to one or two acquaintances with an air of considerable preoccupation,
ere he subsided into a profound fit of abstraction,
which, to judge by his countenance, proceeded from no agreeable
theme.</p>

<p>He was a man of less than thirty summers, sufficiently
well-built, and of ordinary stature, with no peculiar advantages
of person or bearing that should distinguish him from
any other gentleman-private of the Scottish Body-Guard.
His arms, indeed, were scrupulously clean and of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
workmanship; for when a man’s life depends daily on the
quality of his blade, such details become a matter of course;
and if his apparel were a thought more carefully put on, and
of a more precise cut, than that of his fellows, this distinction
seemed but to arise from that habitual attention to trifles
which is the usual concomitant of energy and readiness for
action. A sloven <em>may</em> be a brave man, and a capable; but
if the machine is to remain in good working order, every
screw should fit to a hair’s breadth, and a coat of varnish over
the whole will not detract from its efficiency. Our archer,
then, was well but not splendidly dressed; nor would his face
more than his figure have attracted the attention of any
casual observer. Nine men out of ten would have passed
him by unnoticed. A woman would have been first puzzled,
then interested, perhaps eventually fascinated, by the quiet
repose of that stern, calm brow. It was a face of which the
expression was many years older than the features. A
physiognomist would have detected in it resolution, tenacity
of purpose, strong feeling, repressed by habitual self-control&mdash;above
all, self-denial and great power of suffering.</p>

<p>For the rest, his complexion, where not tanned by the
weather, was fair and fresh-coloured, according well with the
keen gray eye and light-brown hair of his Scottish origin.</p>

<p>The archer’s meditations, however, were soon put to flight
by the agreeable interruption of a well-served supper (for,
indeed, prior to those days, as old Froissart will bear us
witness, the French excelled in cookery); and after the first
cravings of appetite were appeased, he emptied a cup of red
wine with a sigh of considerable satisfaction, then returned
to his platter with renewed vigour, and filled his goblet once
more to the brim.</p>

<p>‘Good wine drowns care,’ said a laughing voice behind him;
‘and Cupid himself cannot fly when his wings are drenched.
Ho! drawer, quick! Another flask of Burgundy, and place
me a chair by my pearl of Scottish Archers, till he tells me
what brings him here eighty leagues from Paris, unless it be
to mingle his tears with the salt brine of the accursed Channel
that bears our White Queen<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from the shores of France.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Mary was called ‘<i>La Reine Blanche</i>,’ because she mourned in <em>white</em>
for her first husband, Francis II.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>An expression of pain shot rapidly over the archer’s face
as he greeted the speaker with a cordial grasp of the hand;
but he answered in the deep steady tones that were habitual
to him.</p>

<p>‘A man may have despatches to carry from the constable
to his son; and d’Amville is not likely to overlook a soldier’s
delay on such a road as this, where there are as many horses
as poplar trees. I could take the Montmorency’s orders
yesterday at noon, and be here to supper to-night, without
borrowing the Pegasus you ride so recklessly, my poetical
friend.’</p>

<p>The other laughed gaily; and when he laughed, his dark
eyes flashed and sparkled like diamonds.</p>

<p>‘My Pegasus,’ said he, ‘needs oftener the spur than the
rein; but who could not write verses, and sing them too,
with such a theme before him? Listen, my friend. I am
to sail to-morrow with them for Scotland. Heaven’s blessing
on d’Amville that he has selected me to accompany him!
Nay, we are appointed to the Queen’s galley; and Mary will
take at least one heart along with her, as loyal and devoted
as any she can leave behind.’</p>

<p>He checked himself suddenly, and a sad, wistful expression
crossed his handsome brow, whilst the dark eyes dimmed, and
he set down untasted the Burgundy he had lifted to his lips.
Something in his voice, too, seemed to have enlisted the
archer’s sympathy, and he also was silent for a moment, and
averted his looks from his companion’s face.</p>

<p>After a while he forced himself to speak.</p>

<p>‘I must return,’ said he, ‘in two more days. Is it true
they embark without fail to-morrow? Is there no danger from
the ships of England? Is Her Majesty well accompanied?
Doth the household sail with her? Ladies and all?’</p>

<p>‘The Maries, of course,’ replied the other, answering only
the last question, which he reasonably considered the most
interesting to his listener;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> ‘and right glad they seem to be
to quit this merry land of France for that cold bleak country
where I hear music is scarcely known, and dancing interdicted
as a sin! I marvel much at their taste. To be sure, they
accompany one who would inspire the wildest savages with
chivalry, and make the veriest desert a paradise! Ah! when
was such a garland of beauty ever trusted to the waves? The
Queen and her satellites! One lovelier than another, but all
paling before her. A bumper, my friend! on your knees, a
bumper&mdash;a health to the letter M! nay, pledge me one for
each of the four, and a fresh flask for the Queen&mdash;for the
Queen!’</p>

<p>Again the speaker’s voice sank to a whisper, and the archer,
who had ere now recovered the usual indifference of his demeanour,
proceeded to do justice to a toast which could not,
according to the manners of the age, have been refused, and
which, in truth, for reasons of his own, he was by no means
loth to pledge. The table at which they sat, however, was
by this time surrounded by the different frequenters of the
<i>auberge</i>, for the archer’s companion, no other than the poet
Chastelâr, was too well-known and popular an individual
in the gay circles of France to remain long unnoticed, where
so many of her nobility were congregated. Young, handsome,
and well-born, his romantic disposition and undoubted talents
had rendered him an especial favourite with a people who,
above all things, delight to be amused, and with whom enthusiasm,
whether real or affected, is generally accepted as an
equivalent for merit. To look on Chastelâr, with his long
dark curls and his bright eyes, was to behold the poet-type in
its most attractive form; and when to beauty of feature and
delicacy of mind were added a graceful figure, skill in horsemanship,
as in all knightly exercises, great kindliness of disposition,
and gentle birth, what wonder that with the ladies of
the French Court to be in love with Chastelâr, was as indispensable
a fashion as to wear a pointed stomacher, or a
delicate lace-edging to the ruff? And Chastelâr, with true
poet-nature, sunned himself in their smiles, and enjoyed life
intensely, as only such natures can, and bore about with him
the while, unsuspected and incurable, a sorrow near akin to
madness in his heart.</p>

<p>As gallant after gallant strode up to the table at which the
two friends sat, the conversation became general, turning,
as such conversations usually do, on the congenial themes of
love and war. Again and again was mine host summoned
for fresh supplies of wine, and the archer, whose recent arrival
from Paris made him an object of general interest, was plied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with questions as to the latest news and gossip of the capital.
Richly-mounted swords were laid aside on the coarse deal
table, cloaks of velvet and embroidery draped the uncouth
chairs, gilt spurs jingled on the humble floor, and voices that
had bandied opinions with kings in council, or shouted ‘St
Denis!’ in the field, were now exchanging jest and laugh
and repartee under the homely roof of a common wine-shop.</p>

<p>Even the Marquis d’Elbœuf, the Queen’s uncle, a lord of
the princely house of Guise, and Admiral of France, joined
with a sailor’s frankness in the gay revel, and taking a seat
between Chastelâr and the archer, questioned the latter as to
his late interview with the constable, and the well-being of
that distinguished veteran, a soldier of whom every man in
France was proud.</p>

<p>‘And you made sail with the despatches the moment you
were out of his sight,’ observed the marquis. ‘I’ll warrant,
you made a fair wind of it all the way to Calais, for the
Montmorency brooks no delay in the execution of his orders.
How looked he, my friend?&mdash;and what said he? Come tell
us the exact words.’</p>

<p>‘He looked like an old lion, as he always does,’ answered
the archer, simply; ‘and he said to me in so many words,
“These letters must be in my son’s hands within eight-and-forty
hours. I can depend upon you Scots. May the blessing
of Our Lady be upon you, my child. And now, Right&mdash;Face!
and go to the devil!”’</p>

<p>The Marquis laughed heartily.</p>

<p>‘He loves your countrymen well,’ said he, ‘and with
reason. I have heard him swear the bravest man he ever saw
was a Scot.’</p>

<p>A murmur of dissent, if not disapproval, rose around the
table, and many of the Frenchmen present bent their brows
in manifest impatience; but the marquis, who had his own
reasons for wishing to be well with the Scottish nation, and
whose frank nature brooked no withdrawal or modification of
his opinions, struck his hand on the board, till the cups leaped
again, and repeated in loud tones&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>‘A Scot!&mdash;yes, gentlemen&mdash;a Scot. And I know why he
said so&mdash;for I too was present at the boldest feat-of-arms even
the constable ever witnessed; and so was my modest friend
here with the cross of St Andrew on his breast&mdash;only he was
but a stripling then, and had hardly strength to hold his pike
at the advance. A health, gentlemen! Do me reason. To
the memory of Norman Leslie, Master of Rothes! one of
your difficult Scotch names. Norman Leslie, the bravest of
the brave!&mdash;Will you hear the story?’</p>

<p>‘Tell it, marquis!’ was repeated on all sides, and cups
were set down empty on the board, as many an eager warlike
face turned towards the Admiral of France.</p>

<p>‘It was at Rentz, then,’ proceeded d’Elbœuf, ‘where the
old Emperor out-generalled <em>us</em> as completely as we outfought
<em>him</em>, and the two armies were almost within bow-shot
of each other. We resembled a couple of angry dogs that are
not permitted by their masters to fight. A clear slope of some
two or three hundred paces divided us, and the German light-horsemen
came galloping out to skirmish, tossing their lances
in the air and bantering us. There must have been, at least,
a hundred of them within a pistol-shot of our lines. The
blood of Frenchmen soon boils up, gentlemen; but we had no
orders to engage, and I, for one, kept my men-at-arms in
hand, for the king was commanding in person, and Condé,
and the constable, and the Duc d’Anguien were present, and
likely to visit any breach of discipline with severe reproof.
Ah! they cannot thus interfere with us at sea; but I ground
my teeth at intervals, and thought, if the order would only
come, what short work we would make with the German dogs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Norman Leslie, however, had come up after the council
was over in the king’s tent, and so, I suppose, fancied himself
free to act. He had but half a score men with him at most;
but he formed them into line, and charged up the hill into
the thick of the enemy. It was a noble sight to see him,
gentlemen, in his coat of black velvet, with its broad white
crosses, and his burnished armour, with a red Scotch bonnet
on his head. How he drove that good gray horse of his a
dozen lances’ lengths ahead of his following! He rode
through and through the Germans as if they were a troop of
children at play. We, in the lines, I tell you, counted five
of them go down before his lance broke. Then he drew his
sword, and though they shot at him with musquetoons and
culverines, we could still see the red bonnet glancing to and
fro, like fire among the smoke. At last they detached a
company of spearmen to surround him, and then striking
spurs into his horse, he came galloping back to our lines, and
rode gallantly to salute the constable in the centre. As he
kissed his sword-hilt, the good gray fell dead at Montmorency’s
feet. Alas! his master followed him in less than a
fortnight, for though the king sent his own leech to dress his
wounds, brave Norman Leslie was hurt in so many places,
that it was out of the power of leech-craft to save him.
What say you, gentlemen? a bolder feat-of-arms than that
was never attempted by a soldier, and it was executed by a
Scot! What say you of a man that would ride through an
armed host single-handed to fetch away a laurel leaf?’</p>

<p>The archer smiled, and bowed low at this flattering tribute
to his nation.</p>

<p>‘I might return your compliments, marquis,’ said he, ‘had
we not a Scotch proverb which implies “<i>Stroke me, and I will
stroke thee</i>.” And yet it is but fair to say I have known a
rougher ride than even Norman Leslie’s taken for a silk
handkerchief, and by a Frenchman.’</p>

<p>‘A silk handkerchief! a lady’s of course,’ said one. ‘A
love-token!’ exclaimed another. ‘Undertaken in deliverance
of a vow,’ suggested a third. ‘Done by an Englishman for
a wager,’ laughed a fourth.&mdash;All had some remark to make
except Chastelâr, whose colour rose visibly, and who looked
distressed and ill at ease.</p>

<p>‘A handkerchief of the softest Cyprus silk,’ insisted the
archer in his quiet expressive voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> ‘and rescued by the very
man to whom I this day presented his father’s letters. And
yet it is no wonder that the constable’s son and a Marshal of
France should be a brave man. I tell you, gentlemen, that
I saw d’Amville at the head of a band of Huguenots sorely
pressed, and outnumbered by his countrymen of the Catholic
faith, so that he had but one chance of retreat in placing a
rapid stream betwixt himself and his pursuers. As he was
facing the enemy, whilst the last of his followers entered the
water, a handkerchief dropped unnoticed from beneath his
corslet. He discovered his loss, however, as soon as he
reached the opposite bank; and dashing once more into the
stream, under a murderous fire, charged through the press of
men-at-arms to the spot where it lay, dismounted, picked it
up, and cut his way back again to his own troop. There
was blood on the handkerchief when his page unarmed him
that night; but I think it was the blood of the bravest man
in France.’</p>

<p>‘And the handkerchief?’&mdash;cried several voices. ‘Whose
was it?’ ‘Who gave it to him?’ ‘Happy the lady who
owned so true a knight!’</p>

<p>The archer smiled once more.</p>

<p>‘Nay, gentlemen,’ said he, ‘it was no love-token after all.
But the marshal is the soul of loyalty as of honour. There
was an M and a crown-royal embroidered on the margin.
It belonged to the White Queen&mdash;to her whom France is to
lose to-morrow for ever.’</p>

<p>‘What a theme for the minstrel!’ exclaimed d’Elbœuf
gaily. ‘Chastelâr! canst thou hear and be silent? Awake,
man! drench thy brain with Burgundy, and improvise us
some stanzas!’</p>

<p>The poet looked up with the air of one who shakes some
painful burden off his mind. He put his cup to his lips, and
answered gaily enough.</p>

<p>‘Not on that theme, marquis, at least to-night. Is it not
the eve of our departure? And can there be merriment for
France when she thinks of all she is to lose on the morrow?
Nay, gentlemen, if you must have a song, let it be a lament.
Let France mourn the absence of one whose like she may
never hope to see again.’</p>

<p>Seats were drawn nearer the table; the guests’ faces assumed
an air of interest and expectation. Through the open
doorway might be seen the humbler servants of the household
crowding eagerly to listen. Chastelâr looked around him
well-pleased, and sang, in a rich mellow voice, the following
stanzas, after the model of his old instructor, the celebrated
Ronsard:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Twenty-four hours had elapsed since Chastelâr sang
his farewell song in the little <i>auberge</i> at Calais.</p>

<p>He now stood on the deck of a large galley, manned by a
sturdy crew of rowers, whose efforts, however, were but
little assisted by the light airs that blew off the shore. The
ample sail would fill at intervals, and then flap idly against
the mast. The measured stroke of the oars seemed on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wide expanse of water to have but little effect in propelling
the labouring craft, and the companionship of a corresponding
vessel at some quarter of a mile distance proceeding at the
same rate, and in the same direction, neutralised all appearance
of locomotion. A bright moon shone down upon the Channel;
and the coast of France, still at no great distance, was
distinctly visible in her light. Comparatively little way had
been made since the galley’s departure, nor did her course
bear her in a direct line from the shore. The rowers also
had flagged somewhat in their usual efforts. Rank upon
rank, these brawny ruffians chained to their heavy oars were
accustomed to labour doggedly, yet effectually, under the
stimulus of the whip. To-night, however, a gentle voice had
interceded even for the rude galley-slaves, and while they
enjoyed this rare respite from over-exertion, many a foul lip,
that had long forgotten to form anything but curses, writhed
itself into an unaccustomed blessing for the fair widowed
Queen of France. Yes, what a strange companionship in
that dark hull, having indeed nothing in common but the thin
plank that was equally the hope of all! Down below, forcing
her through the water, men who had almost lost the outward
semblance of humanity, whose hearts were as black with
crime as their bodies were disfigured with the hardships of
their lot; men whom their fellows had been forced to hunt like
wild beasts out of the society of their kind, and to keep
chained and guarded at an enforced labour worse than death;
and seated on deck within ten paces of these convicts, a bevy
of the fairest and gentlest of the human race, a knot of lovely
maidens chosen for their birth, and beauty, and womanly
accomplishments, to surround a mistress who was herself the
most fascinating of them all, the very pearl of her sex, Mary
Stuart, Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>Chastelâr, leaning against the mast, gazed aft upon the
deck, and listened to the talk of Mary and her maidens as
they chatted together in the freedom of that unrestrained intercourse
which the Stuarts have ever encouraged with their
household. It was pleasant to hear the women’s soft tones
mingling with the plash of the water, and the flap of the
empty sail; but there was one voice of which every note
thrilled, even painfully, to the poet’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary was reclining on a couch that had been prepared for
her against the taffrail of the vessel. Though the tears were
still wet upon her cheek, and a fresh burst was imminent
every time she looked upon the coast, she could yet force herself
to speak gaily, and strove to keep up the spirits of her
maidens with that charm of manner which never failed her
at the very worst.</p>

<p>‘And where is our Duenna?’ said the Queen, archly; ‘I
have scarce seen her since the hour we embarked, when she
walked the deck with her head up and the port of an admiral.
D’Amville yonder, studying his charts as if he were in unknown
seas, instead of the ditch that divides France from
Britain, could scarce have looked more seaman-like.’</p>

<p>The young lady she addressed, a provoking specimen of
the saucy style of beauty, with mischievous eyes, the whitest
of teeth, and an exquisite little foot that was always conspicuous,
laughed most unfeelingly in reply.</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty should see her now,’ she said. ‘I shall
never call her proud Mary Beton again. She is below, in
the darkest corner of the cabin. She has buried her head in
the cushions. She is ill. She is frightened, and her velvet
dress is creased and tumbled, and stained all over with sea-water!’</p>

<p>‘You cruel child,’ said the Queen, good-humouredly. ‘Mary
Seton, you are incorrigible. But we must send down to succour
her, poor thing! Ah! it is only a heart-ache like mine
that makes one insensible to all other sufferings. Mary
Hamilton is too susceptible&mdash;she will be ill also; but you, Mary
Carmichael, you have a kind disposition and a ready hand.
You will not laugh in her face like this saucy girl here; go
down and succour poor Beton. Give her our love&mdash;tell her
she will yet be well enough to come and look her last with
us on the dear land of France.’</p>

<p>The young lady whom she addressed rose at once from her
occupation, which, like that of her mistress, seemed to consist
in gazing steadfastly at the French coast, and with a graceful
reverence to the Queen, departed on her errand of consolation.</p>

<p>As she passed Mary Seton, the latter’s quick eye detected
a few drops, it might be of spray, upon her cheek. The
Maries could sympathise with their Queen’s regret in leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a country that had been to them a pleasant home; and a
woman’s sorrow, as we all know, while it is more easily cured,
is also more easily excited, than that of the sterner sex.
Mary Carmichael’s was not a disposition to give way to unavailing
grief; above all, was one in which the instinct to
conceal strong emotion predominated. With much kindliness
of heart and real good-nature, she was yet somewhat intolerant
of weakness in herself and others. Brave and self-reliant,
she could make small allowance for timidity or vacillation
even in her own sex; and had either mental or bodily pain
been able to extort one exclamation of suffering from her lips,
she would have been bitterly ashamed of it a moment afterwards.
To look on her clear blue eyes, her finely-cut and
regular features, her smooth brow, and determined mouth
and chin, determined and uncompromising, despite of red lips,
white teeth, and dimples, you would have decided that the
one drawback to her attractions was the want of that yielding
softness which is a woman’s greatest charm. ‘<i>On aime
ce qu’on protège</i>;’ and the haughty beauty who humbles while
she conquers, little guesses how a man’s rude heart warms to
the gentler suppliant, who clings to him, and trusts in him,
and seems to say she has but ‘<em>him</em> in the world.’ Masses of
soft brown hair, and a rounded outline of form, feminine
and symmetrical, somewhat redeemed Mary Carmichael’s
appearance from the charge of <em>hardness</em>. Altogether she gave
the gallants of the French court the impression of a woman
whom it would be difficult to like a <em>little</em>, and hazardous to
like <em>much</em>. So what with the danger of her charms, and her
own dignified and reserved demeanour, she had received less
admiration than was due to the undoubted beauty of her face
and figure.</p>

<p>While she goes below to succour her friend, who is suffering
from sea-sickness, we will give some account of the four
ladies of honour, commonly called the Maries, who waited on
the Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart herself, with all her predilections in favour of
France, a country in which she spent the few tranquil years
of her disturbed and sorrowful life, never suffered her connexion
with Scotland to be weakened or neglected. She kept
up an active correspondence with her mother, Mary of Guise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who held the reins of government with no inefficient hand in
that country, till her death. Many of her household were
Scotch. She showed especial favour to the archer-guard, all
of whom were of Scotch extraction,&mdash;favour which, over-estimated
and misunderstood by their captain, the heir of the
house of Hamilton, was, perhaps, the original cause that
‘turned weak Arran’s brain.’ She gave such appointments
in her household, as were nearest her person, to the Scotch
nobility; and she chose for her own immediate attendants,
four young ladies of ancient Scottish families, whose qualifications
were birth, beauty, and the possession of her own
Christian name. ‘The Maries,’ as they were called, accordingly
occupy a prominent position in the court-history of the
time; and as their number was always kept up to four, several
of the oldest families in Scotland, such as the Setons, the
Flemings, the Livingstones, &amp;c., had the honour of furnishing
recruits to the lovely body-guard. At the time of her embarkation
for Leith, the Queen was accompanied by a very
devoted <i>quartette</i>, as conspicuous for their personal attractions
as for their loyalty to their sovereign. It was even rumoured
that the faithful maidens had bound themselves by a vow not
to marry till their Queen did. Be this, however, as it may,
not one of them but might have chosen from the flower of the
French Court, had she been so disposed. Nay, gossips were
found to affirm that many a warlike count and stately marquis
would have been happy to take any one of the four; only too
blest in the possession of a Mary, be she Mary Beton, Mary
Seton, Mary Carmichael, or Mary Hamilton.</p>

<p>A short sketch of each, at the commencement of our narrative,
may serve, perhaps, to prevent confusion, and to elucidate
the actions of some of the humbler characters in our drama.
We are of honest Bottom’s opinion that it is best ‘to call
forth the actors generally according to the scrip. First say
what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors;
and so grow to a point.’</p>

<p>We will begin, then, with the eldest of the four&mdash;the lady
who, with her head buried in cushions, was groaning afresh
at every lurch of the creaking galley, and who suffered despondently,
refusing to be comforted.</p>

<p>To-day it is scarcely fair to bring her before the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Yesterday she might have been seen to the greatest advantage,
for Mary Beton was one of those people who seem to have
been placed in the world for the express purpose of wearing
full dress. The most romantic imagination could not have
associated her with homely duties, <i>déshabille</i>, or dishevelled
hair; and the Queen used to observe, laughingly, that he must
be a bold man who could venture to ask her hand for a galliard,
and contemplate the possibility of disarranging a fold of her
robe, even in that stateliest of measures.</p>

<p>And yet she was handsome, too, in a cold, unfeeling,
haughty style. She had large handsome eyes, and a large
handsome figure, and large handsome hands, which she loved
to display. She was perfect in all matters of court <i>étiquette</i>,
in which it was impossible to find her tripping, and would
have died rather than ’bate one of the accustomed ceremonies
with which she delighted to glorify her mistress and herself.
When she stood behind the throne with the Queen’s gloves in
her hand, she was the admiration of all chamberlains, grand
carvers, seneschals, and such court officials, so unmoved and
dignified was her bearing, so scrupulously rigid her demeanour,
so completely did she sink the woman in the maid-of-honour.
And her disposition corresponded with her lofty manners, and
her fine, well-dressed form. Less unfeeling than careless of
all matters that did not appertain directly or indirectly to the
court, she neither seemed to seek nor to afford sympathy for
the petty vexations and annoyances which a little <i>coterie</i> of
women is pretty sure to find or create for itself. None of the
Maries ever went to her for advice and assistance, only for instructions
and commands. Though but little their senior, she
was always considered and treated as a kind of lady-superior
by the other three, and even the Queen used to call her jestingly
‘The Duenna,’ and vowed that she never felt so unlike a
Stuart as, when after some trifling breach of court <i>étiquette</i>, she
encountered the tacit rebuke of Mary Beton’s grave, cold
eye.</p>

<p>If she <em>had</em> a weakness, it was ambition. If there was any
one road that led to her heart, it must have been through the
portals of a palace, along tapestried passages, between lines
of bowing lackeys, with a gentleman-usher at each turning to
point out the way. She wrapped herself in the folds of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
majestic decorum, and paced along the journey of life gravely
and disposedly, as if it were a minuet.</p>

<p>What a contrast to laughing, roguish, Mary Seton, that Will-o’-the-wisp
in petticoats, who flitted hither and thither
amongst the courtiers, and pervaded every apartment of the
palace with the air of a spoiled child whom nobody ventured
to thwart or to chide. White-headed statesmen, grave ambassadors,
ponderous in the double weight of their sovereign’s
dignity and their personal appearance, iron-handed warriors,
and haughty cardinals, all acknowledged the influence of the
bewitching little maid-of-honour; and it seemed that the most
devoted of her slaves were those whose years and station
afforded the strongest contrast to her own.</p>

<p>The constable himself, the famous Montmorency, from whom
the faintest gesture of approval could have lured every brave
man in France willingly to death, would follow her about like
a tame dog, and Cardinal Lorraine, churchmen though he
were, would have entrusted her with state secrets that he
scarcely ventured to whisper to his own pillow. She might have
done a deal of mischief if she had chosen, that lively, laughing,
little maiden. Fortunately she was thoroughly good-natured&mdash;so
heedless that she forgot in the afternoon everything
that was told her in the morning, and had, moreover,
not the slightest taste for mystery or political intrigue. It
would be difficult to say what was the especial charm people
found in Mary Seton. Her features were irregular, and her
figure, though exquisitely shaped, of the smallest. Dark eyes
and eyelashes, with a profusion of light hair, gave a singular
expression to the upper part of her face, whilst a mischievous
smile, disclosing the pearliest of teeth, completed all the personal
attractions of which she could boast. It was, indeed,
one of those <em>haunting</em> faces, which, once seen, make an unaccountable
impression, and which, if ever permitted to engrave
themselves on the heart, do so in lines that are not to be
obliterated without considerable pain. There was something
<i>piquante</i>, too, in her continual restlessness. Even here, on
shipboard, she could not be still for five minutes together.
She had already pervaded the whole vessel from stem to stern,
above and below, nor was her curiosity satisfied till she had
personally inspected the poor galley-slaves, returning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Queen, brimful of the private history of the two or three greatest
criminals amongst them, with which, according to custom, she
had made herself familiar, ere she had been an hour on board.
Her mistress, though in no merry mood, could not forbear
being amused.</p>

<p>‘I believe,’ said she, ‘that you would rather work, chained
to an oar, like these poor wretches, than sit still.’</p>

<p>And Mary Seton replied, demurely&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Indeed, madam, idleness is the parent of evil; and, doubtless,
even at the galleys, my good behaviour would soon raise
me to be captain of the gang.’</p>

<p>A pair of dark eyes, that had hitherto been fixed on some
object amidships, were raised in wonder to the laughing
speaker, reproachful, as it were, of her levity at such a time;
and Mary Hamilton’s beautiful face, paler and more beautiful
than ever in the moonlight, seemed to take a deeper shade
of sadness as she resumed the occupation in which she had
been interrupted with an unconscious sigh. Sitting at the
Queen’s feet, she was ready, as usual, at the shortest notice,
to fulfil her mistress’s wishes; but the latter remarked, with
concern, that her favourite maid-of-honour had been silent for
hours, and that the novelties incidental to their situation had
failed to rouse her from the abstraction in which, of late, she
had been habitually plunged. It grieved the Queen’s kind
heart, for, though she loved the others dearly, perhaps she
loved Mary Hamilton the best of all; and it was no wonder.
Beautiful as she was, with her large solemn eyes and her
black hair, framing the oval of a perfect face, pale and serene
like an autumn evening, with her tall graceful figure and
womanly gestures, there was yet an undefinable charm about
Mary Hamilton that seemed independent of all outward advantages;
as though she must still have been lovable, had she
been old, ugly, and deformed.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy, nay, a morbid sentiment which bids us
feel in all exceeding beauty something akin to sorrow&mdash;and
yet, who will deny the uncomfortable fact? Perhaps it arises
from the longing after perfection which appertains to our
immortality. Perhaps it is but the hopeless consciousness
that our ideal can never be attained. At least the feeling
exists; and in Mary Hamilton’s beauty, doubtless, the melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
element predominated. It did not make her the less
beloved, we may be sure; and the black-eyed maid-of-honour
was worthy of the attachments she kindled wherever she was
known. A kinder heart than hers never beat beneath a
bodice. Wherever she heard of a sorrow, however trivial
the cause, she was there to soothe. Utterly unselfish, she
was ever ready to sacrifice her own will, her own amusements,
her own advantage, to the lightest wish of another. And
although the very sentinels at the palace-gate blessed her for
her beauty, as she passed through, she seemed the only person
about the Court who was insensible to her own attractions.
Gentle, yielding, trusting, and enthusiastic, here was a woman
ready prepared and bound, as it were, for the sacrifice. Need
we say the victim could not fail to be offered up?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the galley strained and laboured on. The dripping
oars fell with measured cadence on the water; but the
land-breeze, dying away towards midnight, refused to second
the efforts of the rowers, so that the distance from the French
seaboard appeared scarcely to increase. The Queen evinced
no intention of going to rest. Reclining on deck, she kept
her eyes fixed on the cherished land she was so loth to leave,
and inwardly longed for a storm, or any other contingency,
that should drive them back into port, and give her a few
more days’ respite from her banishment.</p>

<p>Probably so unwilling a journey was never taken to claim
a crown; and yet Mary was accompanied by many good
friends, and true affectionate relatives, and loyal subjects, all
anxious to see her securely established on the Scottish throne.
Another galley of like tonnage accompanied her with a portion
of her household, whilst two ships of war furnished an escort,
by no means unnecessary, for Elizabeth’s friendship was little
to be relied on, and England, as usual, commanded the Channel
with her fleet.</p>

<p>On board the Queen’s own ship, d’Amville had taken the
personal command, and studiously refrained from indulgence
in the society of his charge, lest her fascinating conversation
should have seduced him from his seaman-like duties. D’Amville,
too, had long since yielded to the charm of that beautiful
face, which only to look on was to love, and worshipped
the Queen of Scotland with a devotion as touching as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
chivalrous in its hopeless generosity;&mdash;d’Amville, who sat now
in the small dimly-lighted cabin, with his charts before him,
and pressed to his bosom the Cyprus silk handkerchief of
which we have already heard&mdash;the one treasure prized by
that loyal, manly heart&mdash;the guerdon for which he gave up
ambition, and comfort, and even hope. Truly there are
strange bargains driven in love, reminding us of our traffic
in beads, and brass, and tinsel, with naked savages&mdash;a few
inches of silk, a half-worn glove, a thread of soft hair, in exchange
for the noblest efforts of body and mind, the best
years of life, perhaps the eternity of an immortal soul! Not
that the coveted prize is reserved for such adoration. Alas!
that it should be so. Rude hands pluck down the fruit that
fond eyes have gazed on for so many sunny hours in vain,
and the Sabine maiden loves her Roman bridegroom none the
less that he carried her off by sheer force of manhood, not,
perhaps, entirely so reluctant as she seemed.</p>

<p>Chastelâr had been standing motionless for a considerable
period, leaning against the mast, apparently wrapped in meditation.
At a signal from the Queen, however, his whole
bearing altered, his face lighted up, and in an instant he was
at her side. Mary Hamilton changed her position somewhat
restlessly, and Mary Seton, rejoicing in the capture of a fresh
listener, immediately took upon herself to communicate the
commands of her mistress.</p>

<p>‘Fair sir,’ said the laughing maid-of-honour, ‘although you
are certainly an ornamental object, measuring your stature
yonder against the mast, you will be more useful here, at
Her Majesty’s feet, to give us some information as to the progress
of our voyage. Doubtless you are in Monsieur d’Amville’s
confidence, who seems to think himself relieved of all care of
us, now he has got his unprotected charge fairly out to sea.’</p>

<p>‘Hush! madcap,’ said the Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> ‘And do you, Chastelâr,
go below and inquire of our courteous commander whether by
to-morrow at daybreak we shall, indeed, have lost sight of our
beloved France. Already the beacon off the harbour is low
down on the horizon, and the weather seems thickening to
windward. Ah! the next lights we see will be on the bleak
shores of Scotland&mdash;a dark, sad voyage, indeed, with a
dreary termination!’</p>

<p>The poet bowed low and retired to fulfil the royal commands,
whilst the Queen, leaning her white arms upon the bulwark,
gazed longingly towards the shore. Tears coursed each other
down her beautiful face, as she murmured forth her unavailing
sorrow in such broken sentences as these&mdash;</p>

<p>‘France! France! my own beloved France! I shall never
see you again. Country of my adoption! country of my love!
Ah! it is sad to step at once, like this, from youth to age; it
is cruel to feel still young and hopeful and capable of happiness,
and to know that the bright days have departed from us
for evermore. Poor Dido! you too gazed, in your agony,
upon the sea, as I look ever towards the land; and your fond
heart ached as mine aches now, and broke at last, as mine,
I feel, will break ere long. My case is worse than yours; you
had at least your home and country left, though you lost your
Trojan love that the sea gave you, and the sea took back
again!’</p>

<p>Whilst she spoke, she felt Mary Hamilton’s cold lips pressed
against her hand. The kind heart, alas! itself not wholly
ignorant of sorrow, could not bear to witness the sufferings of
its mistress. Her other maid-of-honour, however, took a livelier
view of their position, and was not slow to express her
dissent.</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam,’ said she; ‘Dido gave up a throne for a bonfire,
as I have heard your Majesty relate, whereas you are but
losing sight of that faint beacon over yonder for the certainty
of a crown. Besides, are there not Trojans in plenty where
we are bound? What say you, Mary Hamilton? we need not
look long for an Æneas a-piece, without counting those we take
across with us. Listen, there is one of them singing even now.’</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton felt her face burning in the darkness, though
none could see her blush; and indeed, whilst her companion
spoke, the Calais light sank beneath the black line of the horizon.
As it disappeared, Chastelâr’s mellow voice was heard,
rising above the rush and ripple of the water and the jerk of
the massive oars.</p>

<p>As he concluded, the singer approached Her Majesty with
the information she had sent him to seek.</p>

<p>Softened by her sorrows, influenced by the time, the scene,
the devotion of her follower, feeling now more than ever the
value of such kind adherents, what could Mary do but reach
him graciously the white hand that was not the least attractive
of her peerless charms? And if Chastelâr pressed it to
his lips with a fervour that partook more of the lover’s worship
than the subject’s loyalty, what less was to be expected
from an overwrought imagination, and a susceptible heart,
thus brought in contact with the most fascinating woman
of the age? And the Queen drew away her hand hurriedly,
rather than unkindly, with a consciousness not wholly displeasing,
and Mary Seton looked discreetly into the far distance,
as though there was something unusually interesting
in that dull expanse of sea. And Mary Hamilton, clasping
both hands tightly to her heart, leaned her head against the
bulwark, and said nothing; but rose, as if intensely relieved,
when an increasing bustle on board the galley, and a general
movement amongst its inmates, denoted some fresh alarm,
and the necessity for increased watchfulness and exertion.</p>

<p>It was even so. Their consort, holding a parallel course at
no great distance, had caught sight of the English cruisers,
who, whatever might be their orders from ‘good Queen Bess,’
were as much mistrusted by d’Elbœuf in his command of the
Scottish Queen’s little squadron, as by d’Amville who took her
own galley under his especial charge. In those days the sea
and land services were not so distinct as now.</p>

<p>Signals were exchanged between the two galleys to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
all possible speed, and the slaves, grateful for Mary’s interposition
on their behalf, laid to their oars with a will, in a
manner that could never have been extorted from them by the
lash. As there was but little wind, they soon increased their
distance from the English men-of-war, who, however, came up
with and captured one of the French ships containing the
Earl of Eglinton and the Queen’s favourite saddle-horses.
Mary herself, nevertheless, escaped their vigilance, and an increasing
fog soon shrouded the little convoy from its pursuers.</p>

<p>Thus in darkness and danger, too ominous, alas! of her subsequent
career, Mary Stuart sped on towards the coast of
Scotland, leaving behind her the sunny plains of her beloved
France, as she left behind her the bright days of her youth,&mdash;days
that she seemed instinctively to feel were never to
dawn for her again through the storms and clouds that brooded
over the destinies of her future kingdom.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">‘Oh! ’gin I had a bonny ship,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>About the same hour at which the galley bearing Mary
Stuart and her fortunes, eluded, in the increasing darkness,
the vigilance of the English cruisers, an archer of the
Scottish Body-guard, with whom we have already made
acquaintance, might have been seen pacing to and fro on a
strip of white sand adjoining Calais harbour. After a long
day of labour and excitement, preparatory also to a ride of
some two hundred miles on the morrow, this midnight walk
was perhaps the least judicious method of passing the hours
sensible persons devote to repose. Our archer, nevertheless,
continued it with a perseverance that denoted considerable
preoccupation, pausing at intervals to gaze wistfully on the
sea, and anon resuming his exercise, as if goaded to bodily
effort by some acute mental conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In honest truth, like Sinbad the Sailor, he was oppressed
by a metaphorical Old Man of the Sea, that he could not get
rid of, although in his case the unwelcome equestrian had
assumed the form of a prevailing idea, connected with a young
woman instead of an old man, and resembling Sinbad’s encumbrance
in no particular except the tenacity with which it clung.</p>

<p>Reader, it is worth while to go to the Pampas to see a
Gaucho lasso and mount a hitherto unbroken horse. How
the animal, conscious of his degradation, fights and rears and
plunges, wincing from the cruel spurs to rise at the maddening
bit! How his eye dilates and his nostril reddens, and his
whole form contracts with mingled fear and rage! Shaking
his head wildly, he dashes ere long into a headlong gallop, and
becomes stupefied to discover that, even at his fiercest speed,
he bears his tormentor along with him. Subdued at last, he
bends his neck to the hand that has tamed him, and experiences
a new sensation of increased power and confidence in
submitting to the master-will. So is it with a manly, resolute
nature, when it first feels the influence of another’s existence
on its own. There is a certain charm, indeed, in the
novelty of the sentiment, but there is also surprise, apprehension,
and a strong disposition to oppose and crush the unaccustomed
usurpation. After many an unavailing struggle,
the conquered must, however, submit to the conqueror; and,
like other slaves, he loses the desire for liberty with the consciousness
of incapacity to be free. Use in time renders him
perfectly docile and broken-in; at last he is perfect in all the
paces of the <i>manége</i>, and carries one rider nearly as pleasantly
as another. He is a useful hack now, but the mettle of the
wild-horse has left him for evermore.</p>

<p>Our archer was in the first stages of his tuition. He was,
so to speak, only lately caught and mounted. We can but wish
him a merciful rider with a kind heart and a light hand!</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell, for such was the name in which he stood
enrolled on the list of the Archer-guard, was the younger son
of an old Scottish family, possessed of an unblemished pedigree,
considerable territorial possessions, and a sad lack of broad
pieces. Then, as now, the upper classes in Scotland, with
many noble qualities, were cursed with a morbid desire for
the shadow rather than the substance of wealth. In Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Mary’s days, the pound Scots represented in value the shilling
English. In Queen Victoria’s, the laird on one side the
Tweed, with his few hundreds a year, would fain make believe
that his possessions equal those of the squire on the other,
who owns as many thousands. His difficulties, his shortcomings,
his meannesses originate in this, the paltriest of all
ambition, that would make his shilling look like half-a-crown.
Frugal and industrious as are her peasantry, prosperous and
enterprising as are her yeomen and traders, probably the
gentry of Scotland are at this moment more oppressed with
difficulties than the parallel class in any other country under
the sun.</p>

<p>In the time of which we write, the Scottish nobility were
afflicted with the same unfortunate tendencies. There was
then even more of display abroad and less of ease at home;
whilst the unsettled state of the country, compelling every
baron to entertain as many feudal retainers as he could arm
and feed, helped to drain their resources to the very dregs.
Violence and intrigue, political as well as private, were naturally
resorted to by those who had no other means of replenishing
their empty purses; and what with old feuds strictly
entailed, and new differences perpetually arising, Scotland
could only be likened to some huge cauldron, in which a
thousand different ingredients were boiling, and the scum perpetually
rising to the surface.</p>

<p>In such a state of things there was not much provision for
younger brothers; and as the somewhat heathenish doctrine,
not yet eradicated, then prevailed of considering individuals
simply as links in a line, and postponing all personal claims
to those of that great myth&mdash;the family&mdash;it may easily be
imagined that the younger sons of a noble Scotch house had
small cause to congratulate themselves on their aristocratic
lineage.</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell might consider himself fortunate that he
had the shelter of the old tower at home until he had arrived
at the strength and stature of a man&mdash;that he was permitted
to feed at the same board, and enjoy the same pastimes as his
elder brother, the heir&mdash;that he might follow to her grave
with a son’s decorous grief the mother who had doted on her
youngest&mdash;and that his share of the family possessions was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
not limited to its name, but included a right to breathe the
moorland air round the old place till he had attained his fifteenth
year. Perhaps, after all, he inherited his share of the
patrimony. He gained health and strength, and good manhood,
on its broad acres. He learned to back a horse in its
meadows, and fly a hawk on its hills, to swim in its dark loch,
and to wield a blade within its walls. Perhaps, in bequeathing
him an iron constitution, a vigorous frame, and a courageous
heart, the old lord had done enough for the golden-haired
child who used to come running to him after supper, and pull
his gray moustaches, and climb merrily upon one knee, whilst
the heir occupied the other.</p>

<p>At fifteen Walter Maxwell went out upon the world. A
year after, he was the youngest gentleman private in the
French king’s Archer-guard. Many a dame in Paris would
turn round to look again on the blooming youthful face&mdash;almost
a child’s still&mdash;so pleasing in its contrast with that
manly form, clad in the showy armour of the guard. The
Duchess of Valentinois herself had desired to have the young
boy-archer presented to her; and it is to be presumed that
Diane de Poitiers, a lady of mature experience, was no mean
judge of masculine attractions. A word from the woman he
so adored was sufficient to interest Henry II. in the Scottish
recruit, and Walter Maxwell was more than once selected for
duties demanding discretion as well as fidelity and courage.
All these qualities were, indeed, in constant request at such
a court as that of the French king. At a more advanced
age, the young soldier had also distinguished himself in the
disastrous affairs of St Quentin and Gravelines, where the
French suffered serious defeats; and it was but the consistency
with which he remained steadfast to the Protestant religion
that stood in the way of his rapid promotion. He was a
favourite, too, with his comrades for his courage and soldier-like
bearing beyond his years, as well as for the indefinable
attraction of those buoyant spirits which, like the bloom of
youth on the cheek, seldom outlast maturity.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry II., that chivalrous monarch,
notwithstanding his severity to the Protestants, and the prevalence
of their religion amongst his Scottish Archers, placed
the most implicit confidence in his body-guard, riveting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
unshaken loyalty with many favours and immunities, till
they walked the streets of the capital objects of admiration
and envy to the very grandees themselves. Perhaps the
warlike Henry was of opinion that a soldier’s religion need
not interfere with his obedience; and, indeed, too many of
the Archers might have made the same answer, that some
two centuries and a half later the old grenadier of the Empire
gave on a question of doctrine to the Pope,&mdash;‘<i>Et de quelle
religion es tu, mon fils?</i>’ asked his Holiness of the grim
sentry who kept the door that led into the awful presence
of Napoleon I. ‘<i>Je suis de la religion de la Vieille Garde</i>,’
replied the veteran, with an astounding clatter of his musket,
as he ‘carried arms’ to the Pontiff. We take leave to doubt
if the Protestantism of the Scotch Guard often stood in the
way of Henry’s commands to his favourites.</p>

<p>But the evil day dawned at last. In the pride of his manly
beauty, and the vigour of his warlike frame, the king of
France rode gallantly into the lists, to break a lance in sport
for the bright eyes of his ladye-love. On his helmet he wore
the colours of Diane de Poitiers. And the duchess herself,
looking down from the gallery, felt her heart leap with pride
in the noble appearance of her royal lover. What shall we
say of Henry’s infatuation for this seductive woman, nearly
twenty years his senior, himself the husband of the most
accomplished lady in Europe, for Catherine of Medicis was
notoriously as wise as she was beautiful? What, but that it
is folly to argue on the wilfulness of the human heart, and
that the most untoward and ill-advised attachments are apt
to prove the strongest and the most fatal. The king loved
her madly, and was not ashamed to avow his passion openly
in the sight of France. Walter Maxwell attended the sovereign
as one of his squires, and bore a knot of the same
coloured ribbons on his bonnet.</p>

<p>And now the trumpet sounds a flourish, and the king, raising
his vizor, calls for a bowl of wine, and without dismounting,
quaffs it with an ill-concealed gesture of courtesy to some
one in the gallery&mdash;then, a perfect horseman, he backs his
charger to his post. Opposite, like a statue sheathed in steel,
sits his antagonist, the captain of the Archer-guard. A proud
man to-day is Gabriel, Earl of Montgomery, for the Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
peer has been chosen to break a lance with the French king,
in presence of two royal brides and their bridegrooms! There
is a hush of pleased expectation and interest over the whole
assembly; only the Duchess of Valentinois turns pale with
ill-defined apprehension. She feels the value of her last love,
wildest and dearest of all, lawless though it be. It was but
this morning the king told her in jest, he should not close his
vizor lest she might not recognise him; and she had chidden
him, half playfully, half in earnest, for the insinuation. She
would know that warlike form she thinks in any disguise&mdash;and
the colour mounts again to her face as she catches his
last glance, while he settles himself in the saddle, and lays
his lance in the rest. He has not closed his helmet, after all!
She will chide him seriously, though, to-night, for his selfish
carelessness of danger. Again the trumpet sounds, and the
lances shiver fairly in mid-career. Firm and erect, the king
reaches the opposite extremity of the lists; then, swaying
heavily in the saddle, falls in his ringing harness to the ground.
The Queen and her ladies rushed tumultuously into the lists.
Catherine de Medicis has a <em>right</em> to succour her husband.
Diane de Poitiers, sick and faint, loses her consciousness in a
swoon. She is scarcely noticed, for all are crowding round
the king.</p>

<p>Alas for the gallant monarch! Alas for the bold man-at-arms!
A splinter from Montgomery’s lance has entered the
eye through the unclosed helmet, and penetrated nearly to the
brain. Ere twelve days elapse, Catherine de Medicis is a
widow. Francis II. has succeeded to the throne, and Mary
Stuart is Queen of France.</p>

<p>The favour of the Duchess of Valentinois was no passport,
we may fairly suppose, to the good graces of the queen-mother;
and although Walter Maxwell retained his appointment
in the guard, his hopes of advancement perished with
the death of his royal patron. Such disappointments, however,
though they press heavily on an enthusiastic spirit,
are lightly borne by such a temperament as Maxwell’s. His
disposition was naturally calm and unimpressionable beyond
the average. He possessed the rare quality of seeing things
as they were, and not as he wished them to be. Above all,
he had that quiet confidence in himself which could wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
patiently for an occasion, and seize it without hurry or agitation
when it arrived. Moreover, he had been brought up in
the stern school, that turns out the most finished pupils, after
all. Poverty and hardship give their lessons for nothing; but
men remember them better than Latin and Greek. We may
be allowed to doubt whether all George Buchanan’s classic
lore and pedantic periods were as well worth acquiring as
Maxwell’s aptitude to saddle, shoe, and groom his own horse,
cook his own rations, burnish his own corslet, and keep his
head with his hand.</p>

<p>Changes also took place in the Scottish Guard. The Earl
of Arran, heir to the house of Hamilton, was appointed to its
command, and already that eccentricity began to manifest itself
which was fostered, at last, into madness, by the sunshine
of Mary’s unconscious smiles. Arran chose to alter the discipline,
the accoutrements, and the whole system of the <i>corps</i>,
and such interference with their old habits was by no means
relished by its members. During the short reign of Francis
II., Mary Stuart’s sympathies with her countrymen, and
knowledge of their customs and prejudices, checked many a
proposed innovation that would have created open dissatisfaction;
but when she became a dowager Queen, and Charles
IX. succeeded to the throne, the archers found themselves curtailed
of many of their privileges, and no longer looked upon
as what they considered themselves&mdash;the <i>élite</i> of the French
army. Seeing, however, that, like the famous ‘<i>gants glacés</i>’
of a later period, they had earned this position by constantly
volunteering for all dangerous duties, they might well be
uneasy at the prospect of forfeiting a distinction it had cost
so much hard fighting to attain.</p>

<p>It was during the short eighteen months of Mary’s reign
as Queen of France, that our archer, in virtue of his office,
was brought in contact with the fascinating sovereign and her
court. That he became the devoted adherent of his royal
countrywoman is not to be wondered at; but in Maxwell’s
consistent loyalty to the Stuart there lurked a deeper feeling
of interest than he liked to allow even to himself; an interest
that he could not but connect with another Mary attached to
the person of her mistress. The Queen, as is well known,
was a daring and skilful horsewoman; a masculine accomplishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by the way, that many womanly natures acquire with
great ease. Perhaps, as its chief art consists in ruling by
judicious concession, they have learned half the lesson before
they get into the saddle. As a natural consequence, Mary
was passionately fond of the chase, and followed it with a
degree of recklessness somewhat discomfiting to her less
courageous or worse-mounted attendants. In fact, she sustained
more than one severe fall without its curing her in the
least of her galloping propensities.</p>

<p>It fell out on one occasion, near the Castle of Chambord,
whither the court had repaired for this princely recreation,
that our archer was in attendance on Mary and her <i>suite</i> at
the moment the stag was unharboured, and, with a burst of
inspiriting music, the hounds were laid on. The Queen, as
was her custom, went off at a gallop, outstripping her attendants,
and followed, at unequal distances, by the whole cavalcade.
Walter Maxwell, on a clambering, Roman-nosed
French horse, was plying his spurs to keep within sight of the
chase, when a faint scream of distress, and a young lady
borne past him at a pace that showed she was run away with,
diverted his attention from the pleasures to the exigencies of
the moment. Though the animal beneath him was neither
speedy nor active, he managed, by a skilful turn, to reach her
bridle rein, and so, guiding her impetuous horse into an alley
that diverged from the line of the chase, succeeded in stopping
him before his own was completely exhausted. While the
young lady did not, in the least, lose her presence of mind,
she was naturally a little discomposed and a good deal out
of breath. Nevertheless, she thanked her preserver with
frank and graceful courtesy, avowing, at the same time, in
very broken sentences, her inability to control the animal
she rode.</p>

<p>The confession was tantamount to a request that her new
friend would not leave her. The most determined Nimrod
could scarcely have abandoned a lady who thus placed herself
under his charge, and Walter Maxwell, with his passionless
exterior, had a good deal of that manly generosity in his
composition, which warms at once to the unprotected and the
weak. Instead of toiling after the whole company, then, on
a tired horse, behold him riding quietly through beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
woods, by the side of a young lady, whose peace of mind
seemed to depend on his keeping his hand on her bridle rein.</p>

<p>People soon become acquainted when thus associated.
Mary Carmichael, with a colour much heightened from a
variety of causes, and her rich brown hair disordered by her
gallop, had never looked prettier in her life; whilst a glance
or two shot at her protector from under her riding-hat satisfied
her that he was a gentleman of good nature and lineage,
also that she had remarked him more than once before, when
fulfilling his duties as a guardsman about the court. Before
they had ridden a mile, he had told her his name and all
about himself.</p>

<p>‘A Maxwell!’ exclaimed the young lady, whose apprehensions
were by this time considerably soothed. ‘I ought to
have known you for a Maxwell at once. You’ve got the
frank brow, and the ready hand, and the silent tongue of the
Maxwells.’ Here she checked herself with a laugh and blush,
whereat her companion laughed and coloured a little too.
‘Why, we are kinsfolk at that rate,’ she added, courteously.
‘My mother’s niece married a Maxwell of the Den, and they
are a branch of the Terreagles Maxwells, and so are you.’</p>

<p>‘I have left home so long,’ answered Walter, gravely, ‘I
cannot count my kin; and yet I will take your word for it.
I should think the better of myself,’ he added with a smile,
‘to have a right to call you cousin.’</p>

<p>The archer rarely smiled; when he did, his usually stern
features softened and lighted up almost into beauty. The
change was not unmarked by the maid-of-honour.</p>

<p>‘A Carmichael never failed a kinsman,’ said she, and her
voice shook a little, while her soft eyes gleamed;&mdash;‘or the
old tower would be looking down still upon Dumfries, and
there would be more than a blackened arch, and a few mounds
of grass standing by the hearth-stone, where my father once
received King James. Well, Sir Archer, you have done a
cousinly deed for me at least to-day.’</p>

<p>Perhaps she expected he would make some acknowledgment
of his good fortune in the opportunity, but Maxwell rode on
in silence. A French gallant would have overwhelmed her
with eloquence, and few men but would have hazarded a few
compliments, however trifling. She scarcely seemed offended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
nevertheless. Her mute companion was absorbed in a brown
study, thinking how well she looked in her riding-gear. It
may be that her woman’s intuition told her as much.</p>

<p>Presently a burst of horns in the distance announced the
direction of the chase. Mary Carmichael’s steed pricked his
ears, and showed symptoms of insubordination once more.
Walter’s grasp was on the bridle in an instant, and the rider
thanked him with a grateful smile.</p>

<p>‘The ready hand!’ she said, laughing. ‘Was I not right
in saying you inherited the gifts of your family?’</p>

<p>‘It must excuse the silent tongue,’ he answered. ‘I am no
squire of dames, and you ladies of the court must needs look
down on the unpolished soldier. And yet his silence may
offer more of respect and regard in its humility than the
loudest professions of admiration from those who have never
been taught to say less than they think, and think less than
they feel.’</p>

<p>‘And receive twice as much in return,’ she replied, in a very
low voice, and averting her face from her companion as she
spoke. Then she put her horse into a quicker pace, and
ere long they met and joined a party of the courtiers returning
from the chase.</p>

<p>After this, though they saw each other but seldom, and had
no more rides together, there was a sort of tacit understanding
between the two. Nobody remarked that if Walter Maxwell
was on guard, Mary Carmichael’s manner displayed more
animation, and her dress was, if possible, more becomingly
arranged than usual. Nobody remarked that one of the
archers, more than any of his comrades, displayed unusual
readiness in volunteering for all duties that brought him near
the Queen’s person, and never seemed so contented as when
riding in her escort, or mounting guard at her door. Yet it
was true, notwithstanding; and, although not a word had
been exchanged by these young persons of a more explicit
tendency than those we have related, there had yet sprung up
between them one of those mysterious affinities, that in this
world of ours lead to such troublesome results.</p>

<p>It was not till Mary Carmichael had sailed for Scotland in
the <i>suite</i> of her royal mistress, that it occurred to Maxwell he
was losing time and opportunities by remaining in his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
service at the court of France. He wondered it had never
before struck him so forcibly, that the Archer-guard no
longer occupied its proud position in the land of its adoption&mdash;that
its privates were no longer so well born, its drill so
exact, nor its discipline so perfect as in the days of its old
commander, Montgomery&mdash;that Arran was a weak-minded
enthusiast, who would finish by disgusting both officers and
men&mdash;and that Charles IX. was already beginning to look
coldly upon them, and depriving them, one by one, of the
privileges by which they set such store. Then his patron,
Montmorency, was getting infirm and worn out; and with
the constable’s demise, adieu to his hopes of advancement in
the service of France!</p>

<p>Mary Stuart, too, in her new kingdom, would need all the
stout hands and loyal hearts that she could muster. It was
clearly the duty of every Scotchman to rally round the fair
young queen.</p>

<p>Ere our archer had concluded his midnight walk, he had
made up his mind; and as he posted back his long ride to
Paris, the following day, he resolved to claim his dismissal
from the French king, and to seek his fortune once more in
the land of his birth.</p>

<p>At the time of which we write there were few worse
places wherein to be benighted than that wild district
on the borders of England and Scotland, appropriately called
the ‘Debatable Land.’ Bleak and barren, on a gusty evening
late in autumn, a less desirable locality for the traveller could
scarcely be imagined; and he must have been a hardy adventurer
who would not have preferred the dirtiest corner of the
smokiest hostelry to the uncertain track that led through its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
morasses, especially on a tired horse. Such was the reflection
uppermost in Walter Maxwell’s mind as he marked the dusky
horizon becoming more and more indistinct, and calculated
the diminishing chances of his reaching the Castle of Hermitage,
where he had hoped to find rest and refreshment with
his kinsman, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, and, doubtless,
in that country where horses were so easily come by, a fresh
mount to take him northward on the morrow. No longer an
archer of the Scottish Guard, Maxwell was on his way to
Edinburgh from the English seaport at which he had landed
in returning from France. With his reputation as a soldier and
his family connexions, he had little doubt but that he would
be welcome at Holyrood; and indeed, had it been otherwise,
an indefinable attraction, that he would not have confessed,
seemed to draw him irresistibly towards the Scottish capital.</p>

<p>During the whole of his journey, however, by land and sea,
his destination had never seemed so remote, nor the likelihood
of his reaching it so small, as at present.</p>

<p>‘Hold up, you brute!’ said Maxwell, as he felt if the straps
of his corslet were secure and his sword loose in its sheath,
whilst his poor horse took that opportunity of floundering on
its head.</p>

<p>‘Hold up! If you fall you’ll never get up again; and unless
mine host’s directions were inspired by beer and brandy, we
must be a good way off Hermitage yet. Happily the moon
is rising every minute. Well, you were a good beast this
morning, though you’re not worth your four shoes now!’</p>

<p>While he spoke, he patted the poor animal on the neck,
and, as if encouraged by the caress, it pricked its ears and
mended its pace of its own accord.</p>

<p>Maxwell was too old a soldier not to be on the alert in such
a situation: it was with a feeling more of annoyance than surprise
that he heard the tramp of horses advancing at a rapid
pace over the sounder sward he had left behind him; and
whilst he shortened his reins and hitched his sword-belt to
the front, it was but with a dogged consciousness that, though
he meant to fight to the last, he was sure to get the worst of
it, outnumbered, and on a tired horse.</p>

<p>He had, however, the caution to halt on the far side of
some broken and boggy ground; so that the new comers, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he now made out to be but two, must attack him at a disadvantage,
if they intended violence; and he thought how he
could best separate them, that they might not both set on him
at once.</p>

<p>The horsemen, however, halted immediately they caught
sight of him, and the foremost called out in a loud, frank voice,
undoubtedly English in its tone&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Is it friend or foe? A man must be one or other in the
Debatable Land!’</p>

<p>‘Friend!’ answered Maxwell confidently, adding, as an
earnest of his sincerity, ‘Keep near the big stone, or you’ll
go in up to your girths!’</p>

<p>Following his advice, the horseman and his attendant,
who appeared nothing more than a simple domestic, emerged
upon sound ground. The former was admirably mounted,
and although his dress denoted the gentleman rather
than the soldier, he sat his horse with the ease of a skilful
cavalier.</p>

<p>Maxwell made out also in the moonlight that he was perfectly
armed, wearing both pistols and rapier, and carried a
small valise, with somewhat ostentatious care, on the saddle
in front of him.</p>

<p>‘Friend!’ he repeated, bowing ceremoniously, as he brought
his horse alongside Maxwell’s, ‘foes are more plentiful in this
district on a moonlight night. We may meet some gentlemen
hereabouts who would give us anything but a “Highland
welcome.” As we are going in the same direction, by your
good leave we will travel together. Union is strength; although,’
he added, glancing at the other’s tired horse, ‘haste
is not speed.’</p>

<p>His manner was courtly, or rather courtier-like, in the extreme,
and Maxwell saw at a glance he had to do with one
of the porcelain vessels of the earth; yet there was a conventional
tone of indifference, a something of covert sarcasm, and
implied superiority in his voice, that jarred upon the franker
nature of the soldier.</p>

<p>They rode on, however, amicably together&mdash;the attendant, a
burly Southron, apparently by no means easy either in mind or
body, keeping close behind his master. The latter was bound,
he said, for Hermitage, which he hoped to reach before midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and he seemed to treat his new companion with a shade
more deference when he learned that Maxwell was a kinsman
of the redoubted Earl of Bothwell.</p>

<p>Some men have a knack of extracting information without
affording any in return, and this faculty appeared to be
largely possessed by the well-mounted traveller, who, while he
conversed with the ease and freedom of a thorough man of
the world, dropped every now and then a leading question
that denoted an insatiable and unscrupulous curiosity.</p>

<p>The Scotch have generally an insurmountable dislike to
being ‘pumped,’ and Maxwell, whose shrewdness soon perceived
his new friend’s intention of subjecting him to that
process, resented it by an increased reserve, which subsided
ere long into an almost unbroken silence.</p>

<p>They rode on for some time, accordingly, interchanging only
an occasional remark&mdash;the stranger accommodating his horse’s
pace to that of his new acquaintance, whilst his servant jogged
painfully along behind him, suffering obviously from abrasion,
the curse of unpractised riders, and seeking relief, as well by
sighs and groans, as by fruitless changes of position in the
saddle. The moon shone out brightly, and its light enabled
Maxwell to examine the face and figure of his comrade.</p>

<p>He was a spare man, of less than middle age, with the
marks of good breeding apparent in his thin, sharp features,
and small feet and hands. His figure, though too angular,
was sufficiently graceful; and his face, though pale, bore the
clear hue of a healthy and enduring constitution;&mdash;although
he would have been a well-looking man enough, but for the
restless expression of his small gray eyes, which peered from
under the straight thick eyebrows with a vigilance amounting
to suspicion, and the thin, firmly-compressed lips, a little
drawn in at the corners, as if by an habitual sneer.</p>

<p>Maxwell, accustomed, in his warlike life, to judge of men at
a glance, found himself vaguely speculating on an exterior
beyond which he could not penetrate. The shaven lip and
cheek denoted a man of peaceful profession; but the finished
horsemanship, the hanging of the sword, the readiness with
which his hand sought his pistol-holsters, savoured of the
soldier. Again, his thoughtful brow and worn face might
well become some distinguished scholar or man of science;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
but the tone of his conversation, and the levity of his bearing,
contradicted the supposition that he could belong to the
‘wise ones of the earth.’ He seemed conscious, too, of his
new friend’s observation, and more inclined to court than
shrink from it, as if priding himself on the impenetrable
reserve, with which he could combine an appearance of extreme
cordiality. The restless eyes, however, were not still
for an instant; and the soldier, in the midst of his speculations,
was equally startled and shamed by the observation
which aroused him, and proved that the civilian’s vigilance
had been far more active than his own.</p>

<p>‘I thought so!’ said the latter, speaking in quiet, rapid
tones. ‘There are night-hawks abroad, as usual, in this
cursed wilderness. Did you not see the glitter of a head-piece
over the height yonder? Now, if these are jackmen out on
their own account, you and I will have to trust to the speed
of our horses, which is doubtful, and our knowledge of the
locality, which is negative&mdash;this poor devil will have his
throat cut to a certainty.’</p>

<p>Even at this disagreeable juncture, the man spoke in a
bantering tone, as it were between jest and earnest. His
servant, a stout, able-bodied fellow enough, regarded his master
with a ludicrous expression of dismay.</p>

<p>‘Your horse is fresh, and looks like a good one,’ answered
Maxwell, somewhat contemptuously; ‘keep round the shoulder
of that hill, and you will find a beaten track that leads to
Hermitage. At least, so they directed me. Mine is tired;
I <em>can’t</em> run; so I <em>must</em> fight. If I arrive not by daybreak, you
will know what has become of me, and can tell the Warden
he should keep better order on the Marches.’</p>

<p>The other laughed outright.</p>

<p>‘A sharp pair of spurs are no bad weapons on occasion,’
said he; ‘but I am much afraid I must trust to other friends
to-night.’ He laid his hand on his holsters, and continued,
‘Those fellows will come in again in front of us, and I
had rather face every outlaw in Britain, from Robin Hood
downwards, than turn back into the wilderness. Let us
halt for a minute. I can hear the tramp of their horses even
now.’</p>

<p>As the three drew up under the shadow of some rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ground, they could distinctly hear the gallop of horses and
the clatter of arms on the other side of the acclivity.</p>

<p>‘There are half a score at least,’ observed Maxwell, with
increasing animation. ‘You are quite right&mdash;they want to
intercept us in the pass yonder. What say you, sir? Shall
we pay them in steel or silver? for metal they will have.
Can your servant fight?’</p>

<p>‘Like a devil,’ answered the other, ‘when it is impossible
to run away; and, faith, he’ll be between two fires to-night,
for I can hear a body of horse in our rear as well. What say
you, Jenkin? Had you not rather be lying drunk in the
filthiest gutter in Eastcheap than make your bed here on the
heather, with a rough-footed borderer to pull your boots off,
and an Armstrong’s lance through your body to make you
sleep well?’</p>

<p>The man gave a sulky grunt in answer. He was evidently
irritated at the heartless levity of his master, but he looked
all the more dogged and resolute, and seemed likely to fight
till the last. The night wind, too, bore on their ears the
tramp of a body of horse behind them; and it was simply a
question whether it were not better to charge through those
in front, and take their chance.</p>

<p>After a hurried consultation, they agreed to ride steadily
forward to the pass, at a good round pace, yet not fast enough
to convey the idea of flight. If their enemies were there before
them, they must charge without hesitation and try to cut
their way through, the Englishman remarking with grim sarcasm,
that ‘the Warden was likely to have a good appetite if
he waited supper until his guests arrived.’</p>

<p>As the three wayfarers neared the pass, the dusky forms of
their enemies were already drawn up in its shadow; and a
shot, fired at Maxwell, which cut the ribbon from his sleeve,
sufficiently denoted their intentions. A voice, too, from the
midst of the little black mass was heard to exclaim, in more
polished language than might have been expected&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Dead or alive, Rough Rob! take the man in the centre,
and let the others go free!’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ observed the Englishman, who occupied that
position between his servant and Maxwell, adding, through
his set teeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> ‘I shall owe you one, whoever you are, and pay
it before I’ve done with you, or my name is not Thomas
Randolph!’</p>

<p>Maxwell heard the promise, but had no time for astonishment
at thus finding himself the companion of Elizabeth’s
ambassador to the Scotch court under such uncomfortable
circumstances, inasmuch as a grim borderer, on a tall bay
horse, was already within lance’s length of him, and in
another stride his own tired animal was rolling on the heather,
and he was defending himself as well as he could on his feet.</p>

<p>Two or three shots were fired, the flashes from the pistols
and musquetoons lighting up the faces of the combatants, as
they rode to and fro through the skirmish. With the exception,
however, of Mr Randolph’s first shot, which made
‘Rough Rob’s’ good gray mare masterless, the fire-arms did
little damage, save rendering three or four of the horses perfectly
unmanageable.</p>

<p>As Maxwell shifted his ground, and traversed here and
there, parrying with his sword the thrusts of his adversary’s
long lance, a tall man rode up to him, and shouting, ‘A
Carmichael!’ seemed about to cut him down; then, as if
perceiving his mistake, he checked his raised arm, and
turned upon Mr Randolph, whom he attacked with considerable
energy, shouting his war-cry, as though from the force
of habit, once more.</p>

<p>The latter defended himself valiantly, but notwithstanding
the assistance of his servant who fought with the cool intrepidity
of an Englishman in a difficulty, he had too great odds
to contend with, and must have fared badly, had not assistance
come from an unexpected quarter at the very moment
when honest Jenkin fell from the saddle with an awkward
knock on his pate from the back of a Jedwood axe, running
his assailant through the arm, however, as he went down.</p>

<p>Mr Randolph’s bridle had already been seized, and the
valise torn from his saddle by the tall man who seemed to
command the party. Both Maxwell and the ambassador
were now surrounded and nearly overpowered, when two
more horseman, followed by a numerous troop of cavalry,
came galloping up from the rear, and charged into the <i>mêlée</i>,
with a violence that made a clean breach through the outlaws.
One of them, a gigantic borderer, with a broad, good-humoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
face, rolled Maxwell’s antagonist, horse and man,
to the ground, knocking the rider down again with the butt
end of his lance, when he strove to rise; whilst the other, a
tall cavalier magnificently accoutred, turned Mr Randolph’s
horse courteously out of the press, dealing one of his assailants
a buffet, that must have cut him in two, had it not been
mercifully delivered with the flat of the sword, and rebuking
the others in a voice of authority that all seemed to recognise.
Indeed, a cry of ‘the Warden! the Warden!’ was by this time
passed from lip to lip amongst the outlaws, and horses’ heads
were already turned, and spurs plied to seek safety in flight.
For the third time, too, to-night, Maxwell heard the name
spoken which kindled so many recollections in his breast.
Disembarrassed of his enemies by the rescue that arrived so
opportunely, he noticed the Warden ride rapidly up to the
leader of the band, and say in a low voice, ‘<em>You</em> here,
Carmichael! for shame!’ after which, the other turned rein,
and galloped off at the utmost speed, accompanied by all his
followers save two, one of whom was dead, and the other
disabled. It struck him also that the pursuit was not nearly
so vigorous as might have been expected from the rescue,
and that the Warden appeared far more anxious to pay every
attention to Mr Randolph than to take vengeance on those who
had attacked him. The latter had never lost his <i>sang froid</i>
during the encounter, and was, if possible, more self-possessed
than usual at its termination.</p>

<p>‘Your Scottish welcomes, my Lord Earl,’ said he, ‘are
hearty, though rough. I never was more glad to see your
lordship. It is fortunate for us all, except this gentleman,
whose acquaintance I regret to have made so inopportunely,
that you came to-night somewhat further than the drawbridge
to meet your guests.’ As he spoke he pointed to the dead
body of ‘Rough Rob,’ which was lying at his horse’s feet.</p>

<p>‘Who is it?’ asked Bothwell of his henchman anxiously,
ere he replied to the courtier; and the gigantic horseman
who had rescued Maxwell, dismounting, turned the dead
man’s face to the moonlight.</p>

<p>‘It is but “Rough Rob,”’ replied he, carelessly, after a
brief examination of the corpse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> ‘A likely lad too, though
he was a kinsman of my ain. Ay, Rob, thou’rt out of the
saddle at last, man; but I would like weel to ken wha’s
gotten the gude gray mare.’</p>

<p>‘Secure the other rascal,’ said the Warden, turning his
horse’s head homeward. ‘Let Dick Rutherford and two
more jackmen bring him on in the rear. Help Mr Maxwell
to his horse, some of you, and leave that carrion to the crows.’</p>

<p>The cavalcade was now set in motion, Bothwell and Mr
Randolph riding together in front; the former, after a hasty
greeting to his kinsman, appearing to devote his whole attention
to the ambassador. Maxwell, whose relationship to the
Warden made him an object of interest to the jackmen, came
on in the rear at a slower pace, for his horse was now completely
exhausted. He was, however, accompanied by the
borderer who had rescued him, and who seemed to have
taken a great fancy to him for his swordsmanship.</p>

<p>Dick Rutherford, or, as he was more commonly called,
‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ set much store by that cool courage
which he himself possessed in no common degree; and as he
looked on every hand-to-hand encounter in the light of a
pastime, at which he was himself a first-rate performer, so he
could never withhold a certain amount of facetious approbation
from any other skilful player at the game. He was, at
this period, the Warden’s henchman or principal man-at-arms,
and would have followed his chief to the death, for Bothwell
had the knack of winning the hearts of his retainers by a
rude cordiality and boisterous frankness akin to their own.</p>

<p>The Warden could drain a deeper cup, back a wilder horse,
and couch a heavier spear than the rudest of his jackmen; his
fine manly person, great strength, and soldier-like bearing,
fascinated while they controlled these savage natures; and
whatever deep designs may have lurked beneath this frank
exterior, James Hepburn seemed to have no ambition beyond
the reputation of being the boldest borderer on the Marches.
He would ride alone, or attended only by ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’
through the worst of these lawless districts, and the latter
was never tired of detailing the hand-to-hand encounters with
freebooters, in which the Warden had come off victorious.
Dick, too, was an adept in all the intricacies of his profession.
He could follow a trail like a bloodhound, fight like a demon,
and drink and ride like&mdash;a borderer. With all this, his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
strong body contained a soft heart, and an inexhaustible fund
of good-humour.</p>

<p>After looking at Maxwell in silent admiration for a space
of five minutes, he began&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I would ha’ wagered a hundred merks now that there
wasna’ a man in Scotland could ha’ kept little Jock Elliott at
half-sword like that; and he on his white-footed gelding with
his long lance in his hand. Jock will no’ hear the last o’ it
from me in a hurry. I trow he’s found his match o’ this
side Teviotdale, brag how he may!’</p>

<p>‘You know him, then?’ asked Maxwell, somewhat surprised
to discover such an intimate acquaintance with an outlaw on
the part of the Warden’s henchman.</p>

<p>‘Know him?’ repeated the other; ‘he broke my head at
Bewcastle market only yesterday was three weeks; but I’m
thinking, I’m even with ye now, Jock, my man! All in good
part though,’ he added, ‘for little Jock Elliott’s a canny lad,
and a far-off cousin o’ my ain.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Little</em> Jock Elliott!’ observed Maxwell in return. ‘Why,
he looked to me nearly as big a man as yourself.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a name he got when a boy,’ answered the borderer,
‘to know him from his brother, big Jock Elliott, that’s gone
to his rest. Ye see they were all Elliotts and Armstrongs
that were in the slack<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the night, <em>forbye</em> “Rough Rob,” and
he was a Rutherford,&mdash;more shame till him that let himself
get guided that way by a Southron!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The pass.</p>

</div>

<p>‘I heard another name too,’ said Maxwell, whose curiosity
was thoroughly aroused. ‘Who was the tall man that seemed
to be the leader of the party? the man that rode by me just
before you struck in so opportunely, and shouted, “A Carmichael!”
when he drew his sword.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! it would be just one o’ the Carmichaels that happened
there by chance,’ replied Dick, with an expression of hopeless
stolidity overspreading his broad countenance; and Maxwell,
seeing it would be useless to question him further on that subject,
turned the conversation to the more congenial topics of
horses and weapons, and the advantages and disadvantages of
the new-fashioned musquetoon. In this manner they journeyed
on in rear of the party till the dark towers of Hermitage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
loomed against the midnight sky, and the clatter of the drawbridge,
as it was lowered, together with a considerable bustle
inside the walls, announced that preparations were being made
for their entrance.</p>

<p>Bothwell and Randolph, who had been riding at the head
of the party, halted at the postern until the rest came up, and
the former proceeded to muster his troop once more ere they
crossed the bridge. Maxwell remarked that the prisoner had
escaped, but as no one else seemed to take any notice of the
circumstance, he discreetly held his tongue. Whilst the gates
were being opened, and the drawbridge secured, operations
which occupied a considerable time, Bothwell welcomed his
guests formally to his ‘poor tower,’ addressing himself, as
before, more particularly to Randolph.</p>

<p>‘I regret much,’ said he to the latter, ‘that your duty compels
you to be in the saddle again to-morrow at daybreak;
but he who serves a Queen, as well I know, must never flag
for an hour in his zeal. It shall be my care to provide you
with a proper escort, and my own henchman shall accompany
you to Edinburgh.’</p>

<p>Randolph thanked the Warden courteously.</p>

<p>‘Your kinsman,’ said he, ‘will perhaps accompany me.
He, too, as he tells me, has urgent affairs in the capital, and
I could not wish a stouter escort if I carried a king’s ransom
along with me.’</p>

<p>Maxwell accepted the offer eagerly, notwithstanding the
earl’s hospitable objections; and Bothwell, as they turned to
cross the drawbridge, once more expressed his sorrow that
the English ambassador should have been attacked within his
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>‘I must take yet stricter order with these knaves,’ said the
Warden; ‘there are too many broken men still in the Debatable
Land who get their living by what they can lift. Your
valise is gone, but that we can easily replace. I fear, however,
that it contained something more valuable than wearing
apparel. Despatches probably for the Queen, and&mdash;and&mdash;Lord
James, Her Majesty’s half-brother?’</p>

<p>Mr Randolph could not repress a sneer.</p>

<p>‘Certain letters,’ he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> ‘indeed there were, of no
great value to those knaves, if, as your lordship seems satisfied,
they are illiterate freebooters who cannot read. I have
a few more here,’ he added, pointing to a packet that peeped
from his boot; ‘and, indeed, the only one of importance is
written in a cipher with which I myself am unacquainted.
Your lordship need not, therefore, be uneasy about the safety
of my despatches.’</p>

<p>Bothwell looked considerably put out, though he strove to
mask his annoyance under an affectation of great cordiality;
and Randolph, as he followed him into the castle, seemed
hugely to enjoy the discomfiture of his host.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘She could whisper, and smile, and sigh,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Pleading, flattering, … so can the rest;</div>

<div class="verse indent2">Would have wiled the babe from its mother’s breast.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen of Scotland was fairly settled in her own palace
of Holyrood. We must now shift the scene to the royal
presence-chamber in that picturesque old building. It is a lofty
and well-proportioned apartment, of which, however, the small
windows and thick walls denote that it was originally constructed
with a view to purposes of defence. It is hung round with
a quaint and elaborate tapestry, more curious, perhaps, than
tasteful, representing various incidents in the heathenish history
of Diana; whereon the goddess bares her knee and draws
her bow, to the discomfiture of her rival’s children, with
mythological effrontery. Beautiful oak carvings adorn its
massive chimney-piece, and its panelled roof is richly emblazoned
with the armorial bearings of a line of kings. The
floor, instead of being strewed with rushes, is carefully waxed
and polished, a foreign innovation which has already excited
some displeasure amongst the graver courtiers. Such furniture
as the room contains is heavily gilt and decorated. The sovereign’s
chair of state seems to blaze with embroidery and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cloth of gold. It is a right royal apartment, not unworthy
of the company by which it is occupied.</p>

<p>To-night the Queen holds one of her state-receptions, and
around her person are gathered the flower of the Scottish
aristocracy. Many a bold baron who spends half his life
sheathed in armour, walks none the less stately to-night that
he has donned satin doublet and silken hose, that his brow is
bare of its steel head-piece, and he carries his plumed bonnet
in his hand. Many a dame of clear blue eye and dazzling
fairness scans with critical glance every fold of the royal
drapery, and watches if she cannot catch and appropriate
another grace from her Queen. They are thronging
round her now, for the dissensions which shall mar her unhappy
reign are as yet only in the bud. Each may expect
some fresh boon from a new sovereign, and the baron’s ambition
to become an earl is just as eager, and probably twice
as unprincipled, as the varlet’s to become a page, or the page’s
to become a squire. Even thoughtful Lord James, the
Queen’s half-brother, the lay-churchman, the soldier-statesman&mdash;the
staff on which she leans, little dreaming it can ever
break in her hand and pierce her to the quick&mdash;has forgotten
his sister in his sovereign, and wears on his calm sad face an
unusual expression of deference to-night, because of prospective
advancement and his promised earldom of Mar, and the
broad lands and additional title of Moray, to which he hopes
it may lead. He has taken his stand on the right of the
Queen’s chair, and Mary whispers to him ever and anon as she
requires information concerning her new subjects; although,
with the tact of her family and her own kindly acuteness, she
has already mastered the names of most of them, and has even
gained the good-will of more than one rugged baron by a happy
question regarding his old gray tower or his favourite horse.</p>

<p>But amongst many eager countenances, of which, with all
their different expressions, each wears a family likeness of
curiosity and expectation, it is touching to observe the
chivalrous face and the lofty bearing of the Maréchal d’Amville,
who has come to bid farewell to his Queen and his ladye-love.
With all the polish of a courtier, with all the pride of a soldier,
and with that dignity of manner which noble natures, and
these alone, acquire from a hopeless sorrow bravely borne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
d’Amville kneels before her who was Queen of France in the
sunny days that seem to have shone so long ago. Many a
weary year has he knelt in spirit before that magic beauty
which he now feels he looks on for the last time. He never
expected for a moment that his wild hopeless love could win
him anything but sorrow, yet he grudged it not, nor strove
to conquer the idolatry for which he was prepared to pay its
cruel penalty,&mdash;he is paying it even now. Kneeling there to
kiss the white hand that reaches him a letter for her kinsfolk
in France so gently and so gracefully, looking up once more
at the face that will haunt him to his grave, and feeling that
none but himself will ever know his folly or its punishment;
and that she, its object, smiling so frankly upon him, little
guesses how gladly he would give her his blighted life, then
and there, at her feet.</p>

<p>But, gentleman and soldier as he is, none can guess his
heart by the unmoved brow, the unshaken voice, and the
scrupulous deference with which he pays his homage. Gracefully
he insists on the reception he will meet with in France,
as bearing the latest news from her who was the pleasure and
the pride of the whole kingdom, and his own good fortune in
having been permitted to accompany her and see her safely
bestowed on her Scottish throne. Mary can scarcely keep
back her tears at the allusion; but, with so many jealous eyes
around her, well she knows she must play her part at any
cost, and she gulps them down with an effort.</p>

<p>‘Farewell,’ she says, ‘my brave protector and pilot; be
assured Mary Stuart never forgets a friend. You will advise
the Guises of my welfare and happiness. You will tell the
French court and the French people,’ she added, drawing herself
up and speaking in a louder tone, so as to be heard by
all, ‘that you left me on a royal throne, surrounded by the
bravest and the most loyal nobility in Europe.’</p>

<p>A murmur of applause went the round of the circle at this
spirited declaration, and Lord James gave the Queen a glance
of mingled surprise and approval.</p>

<p>As d’Amville rose from his knee and retired, Chastelâr, who
followed in the train of the Maréchal, passed before the Queen
to make his farewell obeisance. The poet’s face wore an expression
of determination foreign to its usual character; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it was observed by one who watched its every turn, that he
never lifted his eyes above the hem of Mary’s robe. She inclined
her head graciously to him, nevertheless, and he passed
into the outer circle, and was soon conversing lightly with the
maids-of-honour and other of the courtiers.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that the Queen had forgotten some
additional message for her kinsfolk, with which she intended
to charge d’Amville, and ere he had reached the door, she
wished to call him back. The first person whose eye she caught
happened to be the Earl of Arran, who had taken up a position
opposite Her Majesty, and seemed to observe her narrowly.</p>

<p>Not unwilling to pay the house of Hamilton every compliment
in her power, Mary beckoned the Earl to her side and
charged him with her commission. Arran’s wild eye flashed
fire at the proposal!</p>

<p>‘I will obey your commands, madam,’ said he, rudely,
‘though there be pages enough in the gallery to send after a
French adventurer. It seems that France had better come to
Holyrood and abide with your Majesty once for all.’</p>

<p>His tone was so loud, and his bearing so excited, that the
bystanders gazed in astonishment on one another and on the
Queen.</p>

<p>Mary looked surprised, almost scared for a moment, and
then flushed with displeasure; but her sweet temper soon prevailed,
and she answered gently,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Nay, cousin, you shall do my bidding yourself as you have
always done. Have not you and I reason to look back upon
the days we spent in France as the happiest of our lives?
Youth comes but once, my lord, and we shall neither of us
ever be so light-hearted again.’</p>

<p>The unfortunate nobleman trembled from head to foot, and
turned deadly pale. He seemed about to indulge in some
frantic outbreak, which he repressed with an effort; then with
writhing lip and dilated nostril, he strode towards the doorway,
the courtiers making way for him as he passed with looks
of astonishment and alarm.</p>

<p>Lord James, glancing at Morton, put his finger to his brow
and shook his head gravely. The grim Douglas laughed his
ghastly laugh, and with his hand on the haft of his dudgeon-dagger,
muttered something about ‘blood-letting’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
‘melancholy,’ that, had he been the physician, would have boded
no good to the patient; and Arran, rushing tumultuously
through the gallery to cool his brow in the night air, reappeared
in the Presence no more that night.</p>

<p>It seems to us there is a strange, sad moral in the history
of this beautiful Queen. Probably the gift that women most
desire, beyond riches, wisdom, even virtue itself, is a power of
fascination over the other sex; and this dangerous charm must
have been possessed by Mary to a degree that in the days of
Greece and Rome would have been attributed to supernatural
influence. With all her advantages of rank, talent, and education,
this very quality, so far from adding to her happiness,
seems to have been the one engine which worked her own
destruction, and that of every kindly heart that came within her
sphere. Few of the other sex could look upon Mary without
an inclination, at least, to love her; and how many, like high-minded
d’Amville and poor half-crazed Arran, had cause to
curse the day when first they felt the spell of that sweet face,
apparently so unconscious of its power! Of all the eminently
beautiful women the world has seen, Mary Stuart wrought the
most of wreck and utter ruin with the kindliest disposition
and the best intentions. Dalilah, we have never doubted, was
a heartless sensualist, covetous only of pleasure and gold.
The Phrynes and Aspasias were, probably, finished courtesans,
with whom the affections were but instruments necessary
to a profession of which they were thorough mistresses.
Cleopatra, like a royal voluptuary, grudged no price for her
desire; and in her love of conquest, blazoned forth and made
the most of her rich southern charms. <em>Marguérite de Valois</em>
knew and cultivated her resplendent beauty with the diligence
of a devotee and the scientific aptitude of a Frenchwoman.
But the Queen of Scotland alone seems to have been half
ignorant and wholly careless of those advantages which
women most prize and cherish; seems to have regarded her
loveliness as little as the flower its fragrance, and to have
gone about frankly and freely dispensing her dangerous
notice with the innocence of an involuntary and unconscious
coquette.</p>

<p>It is notorious, that even the lower animals acknowledged
the influence of this captivating nature. Dogs attached themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the Queen with their brave fidelity, from the instant
they came into her presence. She loved to dress her own hawks,
and was pleased to boast that she could reclaim the wild bird of
the air with greater facility than the most experienced of her
falconers. Horses that fretted and chafed under the boldest
cavaliers, would bend at once to the gentle hand of the royal
equestrian, and carry her with safety and docility. The brute
yielded gladly, as though proud to contribute to her happiness;
and man looked and longed and grieved, and did his best to
make both himself and her miserable.</p>

<p>Of physical beauty there is no question that she possessed
an extraordinary share&mdash;perhaps more than any woman of
that or any other age. Like her mother, she was of lofty
stature and peculiar dignity of bearing, whilst she inherited
from her father an exact symmetry and the most graceful
proportions. James V., though he made bad use of his
physical advantages, was one of the comeliest and best-limbed
men in his dominions. Mary’s hand was a model for a sculptor,
whilst every gesture and every movement of her body was at
once womanly and dignified. But it was the Queen’s face
that riveted the attention, and fascinated both sexes with its
entrancing loveliness. Other women might be beautiful;
other women might have had the same smooth, open brow, the
same chiselled features and pencilled eyebrows, the same
delicate chin and white full neck and bosom&mdash;ay, even the
same long, soft hazel eyes, and rich dark chestnut hair; but
where was the woman in Europe whose glance, like hers, raised
from under those sweeping eyelashes, found its way straight
to the heart; whose smile seemed at once to entreat and to
command, to extort obedience and bestow reward, like sunlight
penetrating the coldest object and warming and brightening
all within its sphere? Yes, there was many a beautiful
woman in France and Scotland, not to mention such fair
dames at the English court as did not fear to provoke the displeasure
of ‘good Queen Bess’ by too engaging a deportment
or too becoming an attire; but there was only one Mary
Stuart, as many an aching heart in steel-clad bosom was fain
to confess to its cost.</p>

<p>And yet on that fair face was often to be remarked an
expression of melancholy, as though produced by some vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
foreboding of evil, such as cast a shadow over the countenances
of so many of the Stuarts.</p>

<p>Even James V., though he could revel with the noisiest,
and sing many a merry stave of his own writing, amongst
which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘We’ll go no more a roving</div>
<div class="verse">By the light of the moon,’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is not the least suggestive and poetical, bore on his brow this
mysterious presage of evil, although it was perhaps more apparent,
as well it might be, in the pensive lineaments of his
descendant, the first Charles, and the surpassing beauty of his
peerless daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. Was it this that the
soothsayer meant, when Mary of Guise took her beautiful child,
then a mere infant, to the famous Nostradamus, and bade him
cast her horoscope, and fortell her destinies? The sage looked
on the blooming face, turned so artlessly towards his own, and
announced in his deep grave tones, ‘There is blood on that
fair young brow!’</p>

<p>Through her happy childhood in the peaceful islet of Inch-ma-home&mdash;through
her graceful youth, spent with the
daughters of France in the quiet retreats of Amboise and
Fontainebleau&mdash;through her early wedded life and short
supremacy, as through her widowhood, when the <i>Blanche
Reine</i> was the darling and pride of the French court, this
shadow of evil never left her. It pervaded her turbulent reign
in Scotland, her many reverses, her cruel injuries, her disheartening
defeats, her dreary captivity. Perhaps it never
faded from her brow till the glory of death shone over it, in
the hands of the headsman at Fotheringay.</p>

<p>Mary looked round her courtiers in dismay at Arran’s extraordinary
conduct. The sad expression was more than usually
apparent on her fair forehead: she whispered a few words to
her brother, who seemed to be her refuge, as was natural, in
her difficulties, and Lord James, darting another glance at
Morton, quitted the apartment with his usual staid impassive
air.</p>

<p>Then the Queen, rising, broke up the circle by which she
was surrounded, and pacing through the room, addressed herself
by turns to the different nobles present, and was observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to be more than usually condescending to the Earl of Morton,
as though some instinctive prescience bade her deprecate, as
early as possible, the hostility of that fierce uncompromising
nature.</p>

<p>The Earl’s grim countenance relaxed into a smile that
added to its natural ghastliness, as she passed; and Secretary
Maitland whispered to Lord John Stuart that&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The Douglas was in a courtly mood to-night, and reminded
him of the lion in George Buchanan’s elegy that was led by
the lady in a silken chain;’ to which the gay prior of Coldinghame,
contemplating a shapely leg he loved well to display
in a galliard, replied with a light laugh&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I never mistrust the lion so much as when he shows his
fangs,’ alluding to the prominent teeth and unshapely mouth
of the redoubted Earl.</p>

<p>‘Nor I the Douglas so much as when he hides his claws,’
answered Secretary Maitland; and the two passed gaily on to
take part in the amusements and revelry that once more
enlivened the walls of old Holyrood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘She waited not for guard nor groom,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But stepp’d into the hall:</div>
<div class="verse">Around her were the four Maries,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Herself the rose of all.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not always in the immediate presence of royalty that
there is the most enlivening conversation, or the greatest
amount of gaiety about a court. Although the Queen of
Scotland was the essence of good-humour, and when in comparative
privacy encouraged to the utmost freedom of intercourse
and absence of formality amongst her attendants, yet on
an occasion like the present, in a gathering of the great nobility
of her kingdom, it may easily be imagined that an unusual
amount of decorum and restraint was observed throughout the
circle which actually surrounded their sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>At a short distance, however, from these graver seniors were
grouped the Maries, in the splendour of their courtly dresses,
and the bloom of their own intrinsic charms. The young
ladies seemed to have completely recovered whatever ill effects
may have been produced by the hardships of a sea voyage,
and their plumage, like that of certain tropical wild birds, appeared
the sleeker and more variegated for the storms through
which they had passed. We would fain possess the pen of
that eloquent writer who describes in our morning journals the
weekly recurring changes of Parisian fashion, with a fidelity
not to be surpassed by the superlative gossiping powers of
Brantôme or Pepys, and a touching earnestness that never
stops short of enthusiasm, and often amounts to poetry; then
would we detail the tasteful costumes of this seductive quartette
with an accuracy that should make the ladies’ mouths
water, and every hair on the head of the family stand on end.
We would depict in glowing language their several robes of
orange and violet and courtly <i>cramoisie</i>&mdash;the stately fall of
their folds, the delicate edging of their lace, the trim defences
of the jealous ruff, and rich embroidery on the shapely glove.
We would not ’bate a pearl, nor a tress, nor a flounce, till the
dazzled reader should count every stitch of needlework on the
attire of these sumptuous damsels. But we must leave such
visions to younger and keener eyesights, satisfied to take for
granted the radiance of the Maries from the admiration they
excited, and the compliments that were paid them by all.</p>

<p>As Chastelâr followed the Maréchal through the outer circle,
he lingered for a few minutes amongst the maids-of-honour, to
take his leave of the ladies with whom of late he had been so
closely associated. It would have been amusing to mark the
different effect his farewell produced on each individual of the
four.</p>

<p>Mary Beton, half-a-head taller than her companions, magnificent
in dress and deportment, received his salutation with
the dignity of an empress accepting the homage of a vassal.</p>

<p>Mary Seton laughed in his face.</p>

<p>‘Farewell!’ said she, with mischief gleaming from her eyes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
‘Farewell! our fellow-sufferer and Prince of Troubadours.
As you are never likely to cross the seas again, be sure you
take back with you to France nothing but what belongs to
you. None of the hearts of us unfortunate maids-of-honour,
for instance. They are prized in Scotland, I can tell you;
and the Maries want at least as many as they have got amongst
the five of them, you may be sure!’</p>

<p>‘And suppose I leave my own instead,’ answered Chastelâr,
laughing, yet at the same time colouring&mdash;an embarrassment
not unmarked by Mary Hamilton, who shot one eager glance
at him, and turned her eyes away, blushing too; ‘suppose I
must return to France, fair mistress, a loser by the exchange?’</p>

<p>‘We’ll have the palace swept and searched for the missing
article,’ she answered, gaily. ‘I think I can promise you that
the one who has got it won’t keep it. There, you needn’t
look so shocked, Mistress Beton! You can’t guess which of
the Maries has robbed our poor poet so mercilessly. It’s a
sweet name, Mary, is it not? But don’t forget it rhymes to
“vary.” And so, good luck to you, Chastelâr! and fare you
well!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Souvent femme varie, fol qui s’y fie</i>,’ answered the poet,
forcing a laugh, though a less acute observer than any one of
the four might have noted that he was distressed at the turn
their conversation had taken, and that the wilful girl’s shaft
had been shot home. ‘Adieu, Mistress Carmichael,’ he added,
as she, too, in her turn frankly bade him farewell; and then
he passed on to Mary Hamilton, and paused for an instant,
irresolute, before the dark-eyed maid-of-honour.</p>

<p>She did not offer him her hand as the others had done.
She never lifted her looks to his face. Pale as she usually
was, she turned paler than ever, and her cold, distant bearing
would have almost seemed to infer that she was offended, and
that her greeting was extorted from her as a duty of ceremony,
rather than springing from the free impulse of friendship.</p>

<p>And yet he knew it was not so. Though scarcely so quick-sighted
on such matters as women, even men have an intuitive
perception that they are beloved. In either sex the consciousness
produces a kindly feeling towards the worshipper, and it
seems hard to deny a few gentle words where so much is ungrudgingly
bestowed. Mistaken compassion! Perhaps the
fiercest efforts of hate would be less cruel than this ill-judged
lenity. It is like hanging out the beacon where it shall guide
the bark on to the quicksand. It is like Varney counterfeiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Leicester’s whistle to lure Amy Robsart to destruction.
When people pass spurious money in exchange for sterling
gold, they find themselves ere long in the felon’s dock; but there
is no law to punish the coiner who stamps a few false words
with the royal die of truth, and pays them away unblushingly,
for all the happiness and all the welfare of the poor fool he
deceives.</p>

<p>‘You are going back to France,’ said Mary Hamilton, with
a wonderfully composed countenance and steady lip. ‘It is
your home&mdash;I wish you joy of your return.’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ answered Chastelâr, his voice softening while he spoke.
‘You know how happy I have been in Scotland. How devoted
I must always be to this court and this country. I must
follow d’Amville to Paris for the present, but the one hope of
my life will be that I shall soon return.’</p>

<p>He spoke truly enough; he even hoped the royal lady then
employing all the fascinations of her manner on Morton and
his kindred, might hear his last words and give him one
responsive glance to carry with him into his banishment. In
this he was disappointed. The Queen, seated at some distance
from the group, and surrounded by her barons, was for the
moment ‘every inch a Queen,’ and Chastelâr passed out of
Holyrood, with Mary Hamilton’s ‘farewell’ warmer and more
hopeful since his last words, to warn him (could, indeed, warning
ever profit in such cases), that, in stretching for the rose
he would never reach, he was trampling the poor violet ruthlessly
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>She seemed in better spirits, too, after he was gone, although
silent and inattentive to the surrounding gaiety, a distraction
not unnoticed by Mary Beton, who believed herself officially
answerable not only for the dresses and deportment of her three
companions, but for the thoughts and sentiments of their inmost
hearts.</p>

<p>‘I have told you twice,’ she said at length with an offended
air, ‘that the Queen rides out to-morrow for the hawking
after early mass, and that you and Mary Seton will be in attendance.
You will wear the sad-coloured riding gear passamented
with silver, and French hats&mdash;but neither of you seem
to heed me.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>‘She is thinking of a French head, rather than a French
hat,’ laughed incorrigible Mary Seton; ‘but indeed I have
listened to you even more attentively than usual. Ah! Mistress
Beton, what would I not give to possess your careful
forethought and common sense! <em>You</em> never neglect anything&mdash;<em>you</em>
never forget anything. The Queen trusts you with her
state-secrets, and when you carry her work to her in the
Council-chamber, even Maitland and Morton look upon you
as if you were one of themselves. Why are you not weak and
giddy like me, or pensive and sad like Hamilton, or absent
and haughty like Mary Carmichael has grown of late? Look
at her yonder holding the Queen’s train as if <em>she</em> were the
sovereign, and our beautiful Mistress the maid-of-honour!’</p>

<p>Mary Beton smiled, not displeased at the adroit flattery of
her junior. She did indeed pride herself on two especial qualities&mdash;utter
impassibility, and scrupulous attention to details.</p>

<p>‘I am somewhat older than the rest of you,’ she said, bridling
her handsome neck within her handsome ruff, ‘and I have
learned to avoid all pleasures and interests that take my attention
from my duty. I am always responsible and always employed.
I have no time for the follies that seem to afford the
rest of you so much amusement.’</p>

<p>‘And yet you would become them well,’ said the other, coaxingly.
‘Come, now, be persuaded to play Diana in the next
<i>masque</i>. I will dress your hair myself, and the gallants all
vow you are fitted for the part both in person and character.
Handsome and stately and cold.’</p>

<p>‘That is exactly why I do not care to join in it,’ replied the
elder lady, with increasing cordiality, for no daughter of Eve
was ever yet insensible to flattery, even when ugly and repulsive
and old, whereas Mary Beton could boast considerable
attractions. ‘I tell you, my dear, it is better to keep out of
temptation. You envy me my self-command, you say, and I
repeat to you it is a quality I possess because I am heart-whole
and free.’</p>

<p>‘But so am I,’ interposed the girl, vehemently, ‘and so are
we all, I suppose, in reality, for the matter of that; and yet
it is possible that our time maybe coming too,’ she added, reflectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
‘Ah! Mistress Beton, I shall see you some day
with a lover as stately as yourself, perhaps. What an imperial
pair you will make!’</p>

<p>Mary Beton looked by no means displeased. The smile on
her handsome face partook of a meaning expression not devoid
of triumph, as though the contingency were neither very remote,
nor wholly disagreeable; but, of course, the less she felt
it to be unalterable, the more emphasis she laid on her denial.</p>

<p>‘Never!’ she exclaimed, strenuously. ‘I am surprised, my
dear, at your thinking for an instant of such an absurdity.
I never saw one yet, to my fancy, that I could like better than
another.’</p>

<p>‘Nor I neither,’ echoed Mary Seton, eagerly; adding, in a
voice of unusual gravity, and with a wistful expression on her
countenance rarely seen there, ‘I think if I did, it would be
an unlucky day both for him and for me!’</p>

<p>Even while she spoke an unusual stir in the ante-room heralded
the approach of some distinguished stranger who was
to be received with more than ordinary ceremony. In such
cases the Queen’s ladies gathered round their mistress as in
duty bound, although at other times it was Mary’s practice
to retain but one of them in the immediate vicinity of her
person, and to permit the rest to mingle in the general circle,
amusing themselves in their own way.</p>

<p>The duties devolving on ‘the Maries’ were, indeed, much
to their liking, and might well be called a ‘labour of love.’
They vied with each other in passionate adoration of their
mistress, whose sweet temper and generous disposition never
failed to gain the hearts of all those who came about her person.
If there was a charm in all the Stuarts which won blind
devotion from their associates, what must have been the fascination
that surrounded the gentlest and loveliest scion of
that illustrious race!</p>

<p>The Queen of Scots was a thorough <em>gentlewoman</em>, in the
noblest and fullest acceptation of the term. That she lacked
firmness where her affections were involved, and promptitude
of action where her safety was threatened, what is this but to
say that she was a woman and not a hero? Courage, both
the masculine spirit that braves mortal peril, and the feminine
fortitude that can sustain suffering and sorrow, she proved
that she possessed on more than one stricken field, in more
than one dreary house of humiliation and bondage. On both
these chivalrous qualities the last scene of her life drew largely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and Bayard himself, the bravest of the brave, could not have
faced death more nobly than did Mary, the fairest of the fair.
Yet with all this she was exquisitely sensitive of the feelings
of others; she could not bear to give pain; she hesitated to
remonstrate, and could scarcely bring herself to chide. The
regulations of her household, to the carrying out of which the
Queen herself attended with housewifely care, prove the regard
she entertained for the personal comfort of her domestics.</p>

<p>The allowance for the table of her ladies and maids-of-honour
was the same as that of their sovereign. If the reader
is curious to see the bill of fare for a royal dinner in the sixteenth
century, the following are its contents:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Four soups, four <i>entrées</i>, a piece of “beef-royal” boiled, a
loin of mutton, and a capon; of roast meat, one neck of mutton,
one capon, three pigeons, three hares, and two pieces of
fat meat. For the dessert, seven dishes of fruit, and one of
chicory-paste, one gallon of wine, one quart of white wine,
and one of claret; eight rolls of bread.’ The latter item appears
as if this plentiful supply were a dinner for but eight
people. Probably, however, the remains of the feast furnished
forth the inferior tables. A characteristic memorandum appears
at the same time directing that the Queen’s ladies,
including the Maries, shall have the same diet as their mistress.</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael was in attendance on Her Majesty, and
holding the royal train during the conversation we have detailed.
It was broken off abruptly by the stir in the ante-room.</p>

<p>‘This must be the English Ambassador!’ exclaimed Mary
Beton, drawing herself up to her full height, and assuming
her most frigid air of <i>étiquette</i>.</p>

<p>‘He has come back sooner than he was expected, and I
wish he had stayed away altogether,’ observed Mistress Seton,
on whom Randolph had made no favourable impression during
their previous acquaintance, for the latter had held Elizabeth’s
credentials at the court of Holyrood from the Queen
of Scotland’s first arrival, and had been absent to receive personal
instructions from his own sovereign but for a few
weeks.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter with Mary Carmichael?’ whispered
Mistress Hamilton, anxiously, as the three young ladies glided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
into their places behind the Queen. She might have spared
herself the question, for almost ere it was spoken the agitation
which caused it had disappeared; and although, when Randolph
entered the presence-chamber, Mary Carmichael had
started, turned very pale, and dropped the royal robe from
her hand, ere he had advanced three paces, her colour had returned
somewhat higher than before, and she was fulfilling
her duties more scrupulously than ever, with an unusual expression
of cold indifference on her fair and haughty face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘For though I was rugged and wild and free,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I had a heart like another man;</div>
<div class="verse">And oh! had I known how the end would be,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I would it had broke ere the play began.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Mary Stuart stood forward to welcome Elizabeth’s ambassador
to her court, many an eye dwelt on the face and figure
of the Scottish Queen with enthusiastic admiration. Though
dressed in the mourning which she still wore for her first
husband, the dark folds of her robe did but enhance the brilliancy
of her complexion, and, whilst even the spotless ruff
did not detract from the fairness of her neck, the whitest hand
in Europe hung like a snowdrop against the black volume of
her draperies. Even Randolph, cynic though he were, could
not repress a thrill of delight as he approached so beautiful
an object, though the sentiment uppermost in his diplomatic
heart, had he put it into words, would probably have been as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It is lucky my mistress cannot see you at this moment,
or she would hate you more cordially than ever, and my task
would be even more difficult than it is!’</p>

<p>He made his obeisance, nevertheless, with the cool assurance
and easy grace of a practised courtier. The Queen
received him with a cordiality that she seemed anxious should
not be lost on the bystanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>‘A messenger from my loving cousin,’ said she, ‘is always
welcome; how much more when he comes in the person of
our old and esteemed friend Mr Randolph.’</p>

<p>The ambassador answered in a few well-chosen words for
his sovereign and himself, dropping once more on his knee
and craving permission to present an autograph letter and a
costly ring from Elizabeth to the cousin whom she never saw.
Mary received them both with expressions of unbounded
delight, and the shrewd bearer, judging from his own experience
and his own heart, argued that there must be no small
weakness concealed under so much affection, and that it was
unnatural for one woman to be so fond of another, unless she
felt herself uncomfortably in her power.</p>

<p>Mary questioned him of his journey.</p>

<p>‘You have had a long ride,’ said the Queen, ‘and we can
but give you a rude, though hearty, welcome. A long ride
and a dangerous, for indeed the borders of both countries are
not so quiet as we could wish, or as we hope to render them
before many months are past.’</p>

<p>Randolph answered with ready tact&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It is to the Queen of Scotland’s servants I owe my safe
arrival at Holyrood. Permit me to recall to your Majesty’s
recollection an archer of your old Scottish Guard.’</p>

<p>With these words he drew Maxwell forward and presented
him to the Queen. Randolph was a good-natured man when
it cost nothing, and, moreover, it was a part of his profession
to make a friend wherever it could be done at a small outlay.
Mary received Walter Maxwell with the utmost condescension.
Had she followed her own impulse, she would have shaken
him cordially by both hands and bidden him a hearty welcome,
for the sake of old times and the memory of her dear France;
but monarchs must not give way to impulse, and indeed are
better without such weaknesses as affections and associations.
So he knelt low before her and kissed her royal hand, the
while Mary Carmichael seemed to have discovered something
so engrossing in the skirt of her mistress’s robe, that she
never lifted her eyes from the embroidery with which it was
adorned.</p>

<p>‘And how fared you in the wild Border-land?’ resumed
the Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> ‘the land of moss and moor&mdash;of jack and spear&mdash;a
pleasant district if you want to breathe a horse or fly a
hawk; but, as our loyal burghers say, bad to sleep in for
those who would pull their boots off when they retire to rest.’
The Queen spoke of the border as though it brought agreeable
associations to her mind, and indeed she dearly loved the open
plain and the free air of heaven.</p>

<p>‘Had it not been for your warden, Madam,’ answered the
courtier, ‘I might have slept in my boots till the day of
judgment. This gallant archer and myself would scarce have
had a tale to tell, if the Earl of Bothwell did not take to
spur and snaffle as kindly as the wildest freebooter on the
marches.’</p>

<p>‘How so?’ inquired Mary, the colour mantling to her
cheek, and her eye sparkling with animated interest. The
Queen was a Stuart to the marrow, and loved well to hear of
a gallant feat of arms.</p>

<p>‘Why, thus, Madam,’ replied the ambassador. ‘Ere the
moon had been up an hour, we saw ourselves beset by a party
of some ten or twelve horsemen, who occupied a pass in front
of us, and as we were but three, I leave your Majesty to judge
that my feelings as a man whose trade is rather peace than
war, were by no means agreeable. My companion, I may
observe, was all for fighting, without counting.’ He spoke, as
usual, in a tone that might be either jest or earnest; also, as
usual, nothing within the range of his eye escaped him. He
noted the Queen’s interest. He observed Mary Carmichael
look up for an instant, and resume the study of her embroidery
with a heightened colour. He caught Mistress Beton in the
fact, examining his own person with an air of dignified approval
that amounted to admiration; and it was not lost upon
him, that while Lord James looked more anxious than common,
others of the circle exchanged glances of deeper meaning
than his plain tale would at first appear to warrant. All
this he saw without seeming to see, and made a note of his
observations.</p>

<p>‘And you charged them and cut your way through!’ exclaimed
the Queen, with head up and flashing eyes, like some
beautiful Amazon, clenching her slender hand the while as
though it held a sword.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Charge them, your Majesty, we did perforce, for it was
more dangerous to go back than forward; but the cutting
seemed more on their part than ours. The situation, too, was
ridiculous enough, had a man been in cue to laugh!’ resumed
Randolph, in the same dry sneering tones. ‘My comrade’s
horse was rolling on the heather, and he defending himself,
like a second St George, on foot. My servant, saving your
Grace’s presence, a beef-fed knave from Smithfield, roared and
plunged about like a baited bull, till he received a <i>coup-de-grâce</i>
that would have cracked any skull but a Londoner’s,
from a useful instrument that my Lord Bothwell tells me is
called a Jedwood-axe. Whilst I myself, vainly endeavouring
to protect person and property, was forced to abandon my
valise, and turn all my attention to the defence of my own
head.’</p>

<p>‘And they robbed you of your despatches!’ exclaimed
Lord James, interrupting the narrator with ill-concealed
anxiety, while three or four nobles glanced at each other with
looks of covert triumph and amusement. ‘Indeed, Madam,’
added the future Regent, recovering himself with an effort,
‘these outrages are insupportable; they must be promptly
punished and put down!’</p>

<p>‘And they shall be so,’ answered Mary, drawing herself up
proudly, ‘if I ride through the “Debatable Land” myself
in corslet and head-piece, as my fathers did before me. Alas!
I fear steel harness is the most fitting attire for a Scottish
Queen.&mdash;But you have not told us how you escaped,’ proceeded
she, turning to Randolph with marked courtesy, and a
softened manner. ‘You were rescued, were you not, at your
utmost need, by our warden?’</p>

<p>‘The Earl of Bothwell did, indeed, come riding in like a
whirlwind,’ replied Randolph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> ‘at the very moment when I
had resolved that my last sleep must be that booted one to
which your Majesty’s citizens have such a rational objection.
If the Warden of the Marches be chosen for his prowess in
single combat, there never was a better selection! Man and
horse went down before his lance without a struggle, and his
very war-cry seemed to act upon the freebooters like the shriek
of a hawk on a wisp of wild-fowl. Faith, they took to their
wings like wild-fowl too, where it was hopeless to follow them,
and I rode home to supper at Hermitage without the slightest
wish to cultivate a farther acquaintance with that portion of
your Majesty’s domains.’</p>

<p>The Queen laughed as he concluded. She had listened
with obvious interest to the Englishman’s account of the skirmish,
and seemed in heightened spirits when it was over. She
beckoned to Mary Beton, and whispered in that lady’s ear,
who retired from the circle, and presently returned, followed
by a page, bearing a small gold cup, richly chased and decorated
with precious stones. It was filled with wine, and
Mary put her own lips to it ere she offered it to Randolph.</p>

<p>‘You will pledge us,’ said the Queen, with her sunny smile;
‘and when you drink to a lady, sir, not a drop must remain
in the cup. If you examine it, you will see that its sides are
ornamented with lance heads and trophies of arms. Will you
favour Mary Stuart by keeping it in remembrance of your
rough ride and the dangers you affronted in her service?’</p>

<p>Randolph bowed to the ground. He knew and appreciated
the value of such a compliment, and whilst he saw in the
giver’s frank countenance and cordial manner the sincerity of
her good-will, his heart never smote him for the double part
he was expressly sent there to play.</p>

<p>The Queen’s curiosity did not yet seem, however, to be
thoroughly satisfied, and she questioned the ambassador with
considerable minuteness as to the appearance and bearing of
his foes. Randolph’s answers were marked by his usual tone
of covert sarcasm; but she elicited no more from him than he
had already detailed, save that the valise which he had lost
contained in reality no papers of importance, or, indeed, any
papers whatever, except a few private memoranda of his own&mdash;an
announcement which seemed to clear Lord James’s brow
from a load of care, while it created obvious disappointment
on two or three other anxious faces.</p>

<p>The truth was, that Randolph, faithful to his own Queen
in the faithless part which he enacted to another, was the
bearer of certain instructions to Lord James, which were very
different in tenor from the cordial letter he was charged by
Elizabeth to deliver to her cousin. There was even yet a
strong Catholic party about the court, to whom the possession
of these despatches would have been an inestimable windfall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
no less, indeed, than a foundation for a charge of treason
against the Queen’s Protestant half-brother.</p>

<p>The attack, then, on Randolph and his companion, was
prompted by nobler names than the Armstrongs and Elliotts,
who lived by rapine on the borders; but their schemes had
been baffled by the wily Englishman, who fought like a demon
to preserve the valise, of which he was, in reality, utterly careless,
and by that means led his assailants to believe that, in
carrying it off, they had become possessed of a valuable
prize.</p>

<p>‘I am charged by the Earl of Bothwell,’ said Randolph, at
the conclusion of his narrative, ‘to present his unalterable
duty to your Majesty. His lordship, not satisfied with extricating
me from the sloughs of the “Debatable Land,”
has sent his own henchman to conduct me safely to the
capital.’</p>

<p>Mary started perceptibly, and the colour she could not
entirely repress rose faintly to her cheek. Well did she know
that her warden was thoroughly devoted to her interests, and
that, in whatever intrigues he might be mixed, Bothwell’s
loyalty was unshaken to his Queen. Perhaps she may have
already asked herself whether it did not partake of that devotion
which shed a halo over the days of chivalry. At all
events, his sending his own henchman to the court, denoted
some more than usual necessity for communicating with his
sovereign; and Mary prepared to take her measures accordingly.</p>

<p>At that unhappy period, when not a day passed without
the hatching of some plot, the development of some intrigue&mdash;when
every man’s hand was against his neighbour, and
noble preyed upon noble without scruple or remorse&mdash;even the
Queen was obliged to remember that jealous eyes were on the
watch for her every movement, and to practise dissimulation
where dissimulation was alike unsafe and unworthy.</p>

<p>She turned to Mary Seton, who had been listening with
an appearance of great amusement, and gave her some directions
in a low voice, that even Randolph’s quick ear could
not overhear.</p>

<p>The young lady curtseyed and withdrew, first casting a glance
of considerable meaning at Mary Carmichael, who replied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
it, by assuming as unconscious an air as was compatible with
the red spot that burned in either cheek.</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell now found himself in the presence of the
lady whom he had been determining so many long weeks that
he would forget, and to see whom once more he had consistently
abandoned his profession, and undertaken a long journey
by sea and land. As is usually the case, the moment he
had looked forward to, hardly repaid the anxiety of expectation.
The maid-of-honour’s greeting was formal in the extreme,
betraying a degree of coldness that seemed almost to argue
aversion; and he was, of course, fool enough to be hurt and
angry, instead of pleased and triumphant. Whoever saw a
woman accost the man she loves with half the cordiality she
displays to the merest acquaintance? On the contrary, she
receives his greeting with a reserve that to any one else would
be positive rudeness; and even when alone with him, preserves,
for a space, a certain embarrassment in her womanly
shame and fear, lest she should betray the tenth part of all
she feels.</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael was no exception to the rule of her sex.
In fact, she possessed more than her due share of that pride
which, when brought in contact with a kind nature, produces
so much sorrow, and with a proud one so much dissension.
Although the Queen, who was again seated, had dismissed her
from her duty as train-bearer, and she was at liberty to converse
with all the freedom a crowded assembly permits, she
could think of no more pertinent remark to make to her
admirer than the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You have brought us news from the French Court, Master
Maxwell? Is it as gay as it used to be? I wonder you had
the heart to leave it.’</p>

<p>There was something in her manner that repelled and irritated
him.</p>

<p>‘I came to serve my Queen,’ he replied, stiffly, and in a
tone as cold as her own. ‘Our sovereign knows how to
appreciate loyalty, and does not forget her old adherents in
the short space of a few months.’</p>

<p>‘Our sovereign would welcome a lapdog if it came from
France, I think,’ replied the other, indifferently, utterly disregarding
the future suffering her insincerity would cause herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
‘Our sovereign has already expressed her satisfaction
at seeing you, and would probably give you a yet heartier
greeting if you could inform her of the latest fashions in head-tire
and farthingale. We are far behindhand here, you see, in
these barbarous regions!’</p>

<p>She spoke with an assumption of levity so unlike herself,
that he was disgusted as well as angry; and, indeed, it was
somewhat unjust that the maid-of-honour should thus revenge
upon him her own confusion at his appearance.</p>

<p>‘I am no silk-mercer,’ he answered, rudely; ‘nor have I
travelled so far to bring a lady the colour of a ribbon.’ And
with a swelling heart and a feeling of pain he could not have
believed possible without experiencing it, Walter Maxwell
turned away, and lost himself amongst the crowd of surrounding
courtiers.</p>

<p>Far different was the conversation carried on at the same
moment by that courtly pair, the diplomatic Mr Thomas
Randolph and the stately Mistress Mary Beton. The former,
with his keen political foresight, had lately been reflecting
that a close intimacy with at least one of the household, would
open a fertile channel for information regarding the Queen’s
private thoughts and doings, such as would be invaluable to
him in his present capacity as confidential agent to Elizabeth.
He had also observed the admiration which his late appearance
had obviously elicited from the senior maid-of-honour;
and he had no more scruple in deliberately proceeding to make
love to that austere damsel than he would have had in putting
her to the torture, had the latter process, rather than the former,
been the most effectual way of gaining her confidence.</p>

<p>Mary Beton was not insensible to admiration. She was a
woman, and, with all her magnificence of deportment, consequently
inherited the propensities of her sex; but she would
not have appreciated indiscriminate homage; and the dish to
please her palate, if we may so speak, required to be elaborately
dressed and seasoned, and sent up on a silver trencher
at least.</p>

<p>To have won Mr Randolph’s good opinion, however, was a
conquest of which any lady might be proud. The ambassador’s
high position, his invariable assurance and self-reliance,
his thorough knowledge of the world, and sarcastic readiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of tongue, had rendered him an object of considerable interest
to the dames of the Scottish court. They exaggerated, as
women will, his influence, his talents, his successes&mdash;diplomatic
as well as social&mdash;and the favour with which he was
regarded by the English Queen. They quoted him, they
talked about him&mdash;above all, they were a little afraid of him;
and the latter sensation possesses an indefinable charm for the
venturous tendencies of the female character.</p>

<p>Mary Beton was startled to find how gratifying to her self-love
were the attentions of the English courtier.</p>

<p>It was difficult to say by what subtle process he led her to
infer that he took pleasure in her society. Every word he
said might have been proclaimed unblushingly by the Lion-King-at-Arms.
And yet before Randolph had spoken a dozen
sentences to Mary Beton, he had dexterously led her to infer
that she was the only woman in that crowded assemblage
whom he considered worthy of his notice; that their ideas
were sympathetic, their tastes similar, and that a mutual
alliance must necessarily be established between them.</p>

<p>To-night he confined himself to a few adroit questions
respecting the costumes in a proposed <i>masque</i>; and Mary
Beton answered them with a freedom far different from her
usual reticence. All he wanted was to pave the way to her
confidence; and he was the last man to scare the steed by
showing the halter while he proffered the corn. So he took
his leave as soon as he saw he had made a favourable impression,
and went his way cheerfully to sup with Morton and
Maitland, leaving Mistress Beton in a most agreeable frame
of mind, with her head, at least, an inch higher than usual.</p>

<p>We must now follow Mary Seton as she glided stealthily
away from the presence to fulfil the Queen’s whispered command.</p>

<p>With an expression of more than usual intelligence on her
saucy features, that active damsel hurried through the ante-rooms
and galleries, and along certain dark stone passages,
which she threaded with the confidence of one to whom these
intricacies were familiar, till she reached a small vaulted apartment,
from whence emanated a prevailing odour of beef and
ale, denoting it to be the buttery. Spur and steel scabbard
clattered on the stone floor of this resort, and rough voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
might be heard jeering and pledging each other with a rude
cordiality proportioned to the extent in which, as the Scotch
say, ‘<i>The malt got above the meal</i>.’</p>

<p>A grave individual in black, however, presided over these
festivities, and could always keep order by the summary process
of refusing to draw more ale. This official started to
behold the white figure of the maid-of-honour standing in the
doorway; but Mary Seton, with a finger on her lip, simply
said, ‘Lord Bothwell’s henchman;’ and the seneschal, interrupting
that personage with the black jack of ale at his lips,
brought him into the dark stone passage, and confided him to
the radiant messenger before he was aware.</p>

<p>Dick Rutherford, though his faculties were of the keenest
on a moonless night in Liddesdale, was somewhat confused
on this his first visit to Holyrood; nor were his intellects
necessarily brightened by a huge repast of beef, washed down
with strong ale, after a long ride and a fourteen hours’ fast.</p>

<p>Once in the passage, he thought he was dreaming. A
vision of loveliness in shining array, whose head reached to
about the middle of his corslet, accosted him with hasty
frankness.</p>

<p>‘You left Hermitage this morning?’ said she, laconically.</p>

<p>‘At daybreak,’ answered the borderer, scarcely reassured
by this accurate knowledge of his movements.</p>

<p>‘You have a letter from the warden for the Queen?’ proceeded
the damsel.</p>

<p>‘A letter!’ repeated ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ his Scottish
caution coming rapidly to the rescue. ‘I’ll no say but there
might be a bit parcel, or such like. If I’ve no lost it by the
way,’ he added, doubtfully, and feeling the while under his
corslet for the safety of the packet.</p>

<p>Mary Seton’s little foot stamped impatiently, whereat the
giant started in his boots. She turned upon him quite
fiercely.</p>

<p>‘A jackman does not lose a Queen’s packet,’ said she. ‘If
he does, he may chance to lose his own head. Follow me!’
And she flitted on through the dark passages, turning at intervals
to see that she was followed by the astonished borderer.</p>

<p>Presently they climbed a narrow, winding stair. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ascending several steps, the maid-of-honour stopped, opened a
door, and pushing aside some heavy folds of tapestry, bade her
follower enter, warning him not to strike his head against the
low doorway.</p>

<p>‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ dazzled and confused, found himself
in a very small and brilliantly-lighted apartment. The roof
was high; but the room itself was scarcely large enough to
contain six or eight persons. A table prepared for supper,
and laid for two, occupied the whole space between the window
and the ample hearth, on which a wood fire blazed and crackled
cheerfully. The borderer’s gaze was riveted at once by the
gold plate on the supper-table, richly chased, and bearing the
crown-royal on its burnished surface.</p>

<p>Mary Seton could not forbear a smile at his astonishment.</p>

<p>‘This is somewhat different from the head of a glen in Liddesdale,’
said she, with a ringing laugh. ‘Thanks to my
good-nature, you have now seen a Queen’s chamber. Give me
your packet, and get you gone!’</p>

<p>While she spoke, she ran her eye over the athletic figure of
the borderer, magnificent in its size and strength when seen
in that small apartment, and well set off by his warlike gear.</p>

<p>‘What a fine man!’ thought Mary Seton, as she scanned
him. ‘And oh! what a good face, and how unlike a courtier!’</p>

<p>But on ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’s’ honest countenance might be
seen an expression of great perplexity. In the first place, he
was a good deal charmed, and not a little stupefied, by the
beauty of his guide; in the next, he was extremely apprehensive
of an immediate apparition of royalty; and, lastly, he was
embarrassed how to refuse anything to the most fascinating
young lady he had ever yet set eyes on. Nevertheless he
answered stoutly, though deferentially&mdash;</p>

<p>‘My packet must be delivered into the Queen’s ain hand.
You’re no the Queen hersel’, I’m thinking, though well you
might be, my bonny lady, for I never saw the like o’ ye.’</p>

<p>The tone of admiration in which he spoke was so obviously
involuntary as to be flattering in the extreme.</p>

<p>Mary Seton looked pleased, and continued more graciously&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I spoke to prove you. You can be faithful to a trust, can
you? What is your name?’</p>

<p>‘They call me Dick Rutherford,’ he answered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> ‘but in
Liddesdale I’m “Dick-o’-the-Cleugh.” Ask the Liddesdale
lads if I’m to be trusted! But I’m havering. The like o’
you will never set your bonny foot in Liddesdale, nor ask
tidings o’ the like o’ me.’</p>

<p>Dick spoke almost despondently for a moment. He
brightened up though at her reply.</p>

<p>‘A brave man and an honest is the noblest of God’s
creatures. I believe you to be both. Although,’ she added,
mischievously, ‘they’re scarce enough at Holyrood, there are
a good many more brave men than honest on <em>your</em> side the
country, or I’ve been misinformed.’</p>

<p>Dick was on the eve of entering into an elaborate defence
of his kindred, and an explanation of border probity, which
could not but have been edifying, when he was interrupted
by the entrance of the Queen herself, about to sup, after the
fatigues of the day, private and quietly, with her kinswoman
the Countess of Argyle.</p>

<p>The borderer was now completely overwhelmed. Nevertheless,
he delivered his packet with an honest simplicity, in
favourable contrast to the manners of most of her ambassadors;
and Mary Stuart acknowledged its receipt with a few
gold pieces, and dismissed him with her pleasantest smile.</p>

<p>His previous conductor guided him back till she landed
him in the court of the palace; and although ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
possessed to the full the loyalty of his countrymen,
and a borderer’s devoted admiration for womanly beauty, he
had no distinct recollection of the sovereign’s countenance,
so completely was it effaced from his memory by her bewitching
maid-of-honour.</p>

<p>Poor Dick! Many a long day afterwards his honest heart
ached when he thought of that memorable night, recalling the
merry eyes and the sunny hair and the dazzling figure of
his fascinating guide. Brave, simple ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh!’
He had better have been up to his neck in the softest moss in
all Liddesdale.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘But had I wist, before I kist,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That love had been sae hard to win,</div>
<div class="verse">I’d have lock’d my heart in a case of gowd,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">An’ pinn’d it wi’ a siller pin.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was the anniversary of the death of Francis II., and Mary,
whose attachment to her youthful husband evinced itself
by a scrupulous respect for his memory, had ordered a dirge to
be performed in the Royal Chapel at Holyrood for the repose
of his soul. The sacred edifice had been appropriately hung
with black; nor was any accessory neglected that could enhance
the gloom of the scene. Carpenters had been employed
for some days previously in preparing the mournful display;
and a good deal of murmuring and discontent had arisen both
in the court and city at the proposed ordinance. The <i>Godly</i>,
as the Protestant party somewhat presumptuously termed
themselves, mistrusted this return to papal ceremonials, and
made no secret of their dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Mary, however, tolerant as she was of opposite opinions,
always remained staunch to the ritual in which she had been
brought up, and spared no pains to carry out with due pomp
a solemnity which she esteemed essential to the occasion.</p>

<p>The morning broke gloomily, when the Queen, attired in
deep mourning, and attended only by Lady Hamilton, entered
the chapel for early mass. Her lovely face looked paler than
usual under the veil of crape which shaded it, and there was
an expression of something more than sorrow, of annoyance
and apprehension, on its lineaments. Perhaps she was thinking
of her brief reign in France, not long enough for a
sovereign to discover the many troubles and anxieties that
line a crown. Perhaps she was recalling the adoration she
had been used to receive from the excitable French people,
and contrasting it with the gloomy brows and ominous
mutterings she had already encountered amongst her new
subjects.</p>

<p>Mary had been but a few weeks on the Scottish throne, ere
she became aware that even her beauty and her bereavement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were not sufficient to cover the <i>odium</i> of her religion in the
eyes of these northern zealots, and that Protestantism might
esteem it a duty both to God and man to insult a helpless
woman because she was a Catholic Queen.</p>

<p>As she passed slowly up the aisle with weary step and
downcast air, followed by her maid-of-honour, it may be that
both the women were longing wearily for that rest which
they came here to seek&mdash;glad to be relieved, if but for an
hour, of the burden which at some future time they should
cast down at once and for ever&mdash;almost wishing that the time
was come, and the journey over, and the resting-place at hand.</p>

<p>And now the anthem swells and sinks and fills the echoing
aisle; and the crimson light streams through the deep-stained
windows on chiselled font and sculptured cross and monumental
marble, while the tones of the choristers rise and fall
like the song of angels speaking of hope and peace and
pardon for the penitent&mdash;wailing in their celestial sorrow for
the loved that yet are lost for evermore.</p>

<p>In that flood of harmony the Queen bathed her wounded
spirit, bidding it contemn the reefs and rocks that beset its
earthly course as it floated, if but for an instant, towards the
eternal shore; and Mary Hamilton, joining in the tide of
prayer and praise, forgot her hopes and fears, her tottering
happiness and earthly misgivings, while she felt that there
was yet in store for her a home of endless welcome, a joy that
no uncertainty could poison, a love no falsehood could take
away.</p>

<p>Prosperity goes to church, as well it may, to return thanks
for the benefits it has received; to fulfil, as it were, its own
part of the compact by which it flourishes; to acknowledge
its advantages and to entreat their continuance; then it walks
back into the sunshine in its purple and fine linen, with a
pleasant consciousness of debts discharged and duties well fulfilled.
Not so its ailing brother, gaunt Adversity. For the
latter the temple of God is the temple of refuge, the temple
of healing, the temple of consolation; thither it may bring
its sores and its sackcloth, without misgivings and without
shame; there it is on a level with the proudest, and in unison
with the happiest; it drinks from the same stream, and out
of the same cup; it returns to its labour and its sorrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
strengthened and refreshed. Though the heart be aching, it
is sound and unbroken still; and the storms may pelt their
fiercest, it only longs the more to come again.</p>

<p>As the anthem proceeded the Scottish Queen became aware
that another voice had been added to her choir, of considerable
depth and volume, thereby completing its harmony and
greatly enhancing its effect. This organ was the property of
an individual whose unfortunate destiny it was to make a far
greater stir at the court of Holyrood than became either his
talents or his station, and to meet with a fate which his antecedents
did not deserve.</p>

<p>In the train of the Count de Moretta, ambassador from the
court of Savoy, the Duke of which principality was another
unsuccessful suitor for the hand of the Scottish Queen, came
a good-humoured little Italian, David Riccio by name, whose
especial gifts at this period seem to have been a knack of
mimicry, not unusual among his countrymen, and a fine bass
voice of great power and sweetness.</p>

<p>These were the qualities that first recommended him to the
notice of Mary; and when, in addition to his musical acquirements,
she found him quick-witted, ready and obliging, fluent
with the pen, and a perfect master of the French language,
she promoted the good-humoured, deformed, and diminutive
foreigner to the post of private secretary, little dreaming of
the construction which would hereafter be put upon so harmless
an appointment.</p>

<p>In the meantime Riccio revelled in the exercise of his
delightful talent&mdash;filling the crape-hung building with his
notes of mournful melody&mdash;and Mary listened entranced, and
forgot for the moment her troubles, her widowhood, and her
crown.</p>

<p>But the charms of music, and even the consolations of religion,
can but stave off earthly cares for a brief period of
repose, after which they are prone to thrust themselves on our
notice with a vigour all the more imperative for such temporary
respite. When mass was concluded, and Mary, with
her maid-of-honour, was about to quit the chapel, she could
not but observe how none, save her immediate attendants and
personal household, had assisted to form the congregation;
how the nobility of her court, with but few exceptions, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
remained outside, with a certain ostentatious assumption of
dissent from the religion of their Queen. She could not help
remarking as much to her attendant.</p>

<p>‘Do you not see, my dear,’ said she, bitterly, ‘how the new
religion is disposed to charity and toleration? My Protestant
lords will not even join in the devotions of their Sovereign,
when she prays for the welfare of her husband’s soul. They
will not “weep with those who weep,” nor “rejoice with
those who rejoice,” unless it be by Master Knox’s permission,
and in black cassock and Geneva band. Verily, Mary Hamilton,
it is a weary lot to be a woman, but it is a daily humiliation
to be a Queen!’</p>

<p>‘I know not what a Queen’s trials may be, madam,’
answered the other, on whose sweet face the halo of devotion
had not yet faded away; ‘but a woman’s sorrows, I fancy,
may be too hard for a woman to bear, unless she brings them
with her unreservedly and lays them all down here.’</p>

<p>While she spoke she stood near the chapel-door, and the
December sun, shedding its rays through the deep red cross
of the stained window above, streamed full upon her fair and
gentle face. It seemed to her mistress, even then, that she
looked like some patient saint, purified by suffering, and bearing
the cross of her Master in the red glory of martyrdom.</p>

<p>But such holy thoughts as these were soon driven from
Mary’s mind by fresh annoyances. On leaving her chapel,
and emerging into the courtyard of her palace, the Queen
found it crowded by an assemblage of her nobility, whose
motley apparel, of the gayest and gaudiest hues, contrasted
offensively with her own sad mourning garb. Not one of
them had shown sufficient sympathy with her feelings to wear
so much as a black ribbon on his doublet, or to doff the
plume that flaunted from his rich velvet bonnet. Stung to
the quick by such disrespect, Mary determined to meet it by
an insult as injudicious as it was unworthy. Halting on the
threshold of her chapel, she took not the slightest notice of the
salutations offered her by the proudest lords in Scotland, but
beckoned to the new singer, whose voice had recently so much
delighted her, and giving him her missal to carry, complimented
him with marked familiarity on his performance; and
so, holding the astonished Italian in conversation at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
chapel-door, kept every one else waiting uncovered until she
had done with him.</p>

<p>Many a haughty brow was already bent on the unknown
stranger. Gray moustaches, that had bristled in the teeth of
the English archers at Flodden, were pulled in mingled
astonishment and anger; while hands, always too prompt to
shed blood, gripped dagger and sword-hilt, as though neither
the sacred locality nor the presence of the sovereign would
long restrain them from open violence. The first impulse of
the Scottish noble was to resent an insult or avenge an injury
on the spot. Morton alone, of all the crowd, seemed
to experience neither indignation nor surprise. The smile
that gave his face so fiendish an expression only deepened
and hardened round his mouth. He glanced from the Queen
to her ill-chosen favourite with looks rather of amused malignity
than offended pride. Morton’s will was strong in proportion
to his passions, and these, with all their abiding
energy, were thoroughly under the control of his hard unfeeling
nature. The Douglas was, indeed, one of those who
would ‘strike sooner than speak, and drink sooner than
pray;’ yet he only glared on the singer with a kind of
comic ferocity, and the poor little Italian shrunk nearer his
protectress with a prophetic horror of the hard-featured
earl.</p>

<p>Bidding Riccio follow in her train, the Queen passed on
through the cloisters of the palace towards her own apartments,
returning with cold courtesy the salutations of her
nobility. The courtiers looked meaningly at each other, and
then at the new favourite, who slunk along behind his mistress,
bearing her gorgeous missal, in ludicrous dismay. Secretary
Maitland, a man whose wits were always at hand, and
who could transact more business in ten minutes than the
rest of the Privy Council in as many days, approached her
Majesty with a huge bundle of papers under his arm, and
the Queen, taking them from him without remark, handed
the whole at once to Riccio. The secretary ventured on an
expostulation.</p>

<p>‘They are for your Majesty’s <em>private</em> information,’ said he,
deferentially, but in a tone of marked disapproval.</p>

<p>‘And I have given them to my <em>private</em> secretary,’ replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Mary, haughtily; thus hastily and injudiciously confirming
the appointment that led to such disastrous results.</p>

<p>‘Shall I attend your Grace to explain their contents?’
asked Maitland, as coolly as if nothing unusual had taken
place.</p>

<p>‘When I send for you, sir,’ answered the Queen; and
even Maitland’s assurance was compelled to give way. He
could but bow and fall back amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>Some of the nobles were so offended that they quitted
the court on the spot; others thought it a bad opportunity
to press their respective suits with the sovereign, and lounged
off, as it were inadvertently, to their different amusements
and occupations&mdash;one to fly a hawk, another to try a horse,
not a few to break their fast on rich food and strong potations;
the while they discussed the gossip of the court, which had received
no inconsiderable fillip from the events of the morning.</p>

<p>Lord James walked gravely away to Mr Randolph’s lodging.
His brother, the gay lay-prior of Coldinghame, mounted
his horse to join a merry-making on Leith sands. The Earl
of Huntly and the Earl Mareschal departed to prepare an
ordinance for the council, discussing, to all appearance,
weighty matters of state; yet, perhaps, could their dialogue
have been overheard, it related to far less important topics.
The courtyard of the palace was almost deserted, and Mary,
dismissing her maid-of-honour and the Italian, prepared to
take a solitary turn up and down the cloisters, to soothe her
temper and compose her troubled mind.</p>

<p>The Queen thought she was alone. It was not so, however;
for, from the moment of her leaving the chapel, her
movements had been watched by a man concealed behind one
of the arches; and no sooner had her attendants quitted her
than he emerged from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>Mary started, and almost screamed, as this unexpected
figure stepped forth and stood in front of her. Indeed, a
bolder nature might have been alarmed at its wild appearance
and the vehemence of its gestures.</p>

<p>Pale and haggard, all unbraced, and with disordered dress&mdash;but
unarmed, even to his sword&mdash;the Earl of Arran confronted
Mary Stuart with none of the ceremony observed by
a subject in the presence of his Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>‘At last!’ he shouted, with passionate vehemence, and
placing himself so that she could not pass by him,&mdash;‘at
last I see thee once more. After weary hours of watching
by night and day, after danger and difficulty and longing, I
see thee once more. No longer the Queen of Scotland, surrounded
by her court, and haughty in all the panoply of
royalty, but Mary Stuart, the flower of womanhood, the darling
of France, and the idol of Arran’s heart.’</p>

<p>‘What mean you, my lord?’ exclaimed the Queen, utterly
aghast at this unheard-of proceeding, and hardly knowing,
in her astonishment, whether to stand or fly. ‘Are you
mad or dreaming? I am, indeed, Mary Stuart, and it is not
thus I should be accosted by the Earl of Arran.’</p>

<p>‘Mad!’ returned the unfortunate nobleman, the wild cunning
of insanity gleaming from his eye, and pointing with
his wasted hand to the palace windows as he spoke. ‘Hark
ye, madam; they are mad up yonder. Mad from vaults to
roof of this accursed building, this stronghold of superstition
and Papacy. The Lord James is mad, who would deliver his
sister into the hands of the ungodly; the priests are mad,
who would withhold her, by main force, from the tidings of
salvation; the choristers are mad, singing their unholy
dirges for the souls that are gone to perdition. Mary! Mary!’&mdash;he
changed to accents of wild affection and entreaty&mdash;‘I
alone am devoted to you. The house of Hamilton is the only
refuge for the Stuart.’</p>

<p>Mary was constitutionally brave. Her courage began to
return as she reflected she was within call of her household
and retainers. She had a natural regard, too, for her kinsman;
and a woman’s pity for the wreck that something
within, too truly, told her she herself had made. She tried
to quiet the poor maniac with soothing, gentle words.</p>

<p>‘Nay, cousin,’ said the Queen, ‘when have I doubted
your loyalty or your honour? Why come to assure me of it
at this unbecoming hour, and in this unbecoming guise?
You are afflicted, Arran, and ill at ease. Retire into the
palace; our own physician shall attend you; the best of
lodging and the best of care shall not be grudged to my kinsman.’</p>

<p>For a moment Arran seemed calmer, and once or twice he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
passed his hand across his brow, as though waking from
some troubled sleep, or trying to recall some lost recollection.
And, indeed, whilst the Queen kept her eye on him, though
he tried hard to avoid her glance, it held him in a certain
subjection. No sooner, however, was it withdrawn, than his
madness blazed forth once more.</p>

<p>‘It is the plot!’ he shouted again, as though addressing
some imaginary audience, ‘the accursed, traitorous plot, that
I alone have power to prevent. Papist and Protestant, rebel
and renegade, from the four winds of heaven, they are banded
together to carry off my Queen. Listen, madam; on my knees,
I implore you to listen.’</p>

<p>He knelt, and clasped Mary’s hand in both his own.</p>

<p>‘I have discovered a conspiracy to seize your royal person,
and to carry you into bondage. Lord James has consented
to join in it. The Earls of Seton and Livingstone have
signed the bond drawn up by smooth and crafty Lethington,
with every name attached in characters of blood, except his
own. Morton has promised his assistance; for when was
the Douglas out of any scheme of violence and crime? And
Bothwell, with his border reprobates, is to put it in execution;
but Arran will save his Queen.’</p>

<p>‘How say you? Morton? my brother? trusty Seton? and
Bothwell, loyal and true? Impossible! You are raving,’
said the Queen, now thoroughly alarmed. ‘Where shall I
turn to? What shall I do?’</p>

<p>‘The Hamiltons will rally round the Stuart!’ exclaimed
the maniac, rising from his knees, and making as though he
would seize Mary in his arms.</p>

<p>Before she could call for help, however, he suddenly desisted
from his purpose, and placing his finger on his lip with
a gesture of caution and a glance at the Queen, in which
cunning and imbecility were strangely mingled, moved swiftly
and stealthily away.</p>

<p>With the quick perceptions of insanity, he had caught the
sound of an armed step approaching through the cloisters;
and ere Mary had recovered from her dismay, a tall, warlike
figure bowed to its very sword-hilt before her, and she found
herself face to face with the Warden of the Marches.</p>

<p>He had been riding all night to reach Holyrood. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
galloped on ahead of the best-mounted of his troop, who were
even now rounding the base of Arthur’s Seat, as they neared
the Scottish capital. In those troubled times there was no
lack of excuses for the warden to seek personal instructions
from his sovereign, and Bothwell had availed himself of some
late misunderstanding with Lord Scrope, the warden on the
English side, to obtain an audience of the Queen. With a
wild feverish longing for the sweet face, to behold which was
fast becoming a necessity of his existence, he had hurried to
the presence of his sovereign. And now, when the moment
had at last arrived, the colour faded in his bronzed cheek, and
he trembled, that strong man-at-arms, like a girl.</p>

<p>Agitated and frightened as she was, Mary recovered herself
sufficiently to receive him with becoming dignity. As
his stalwart figure bent in homage, and the upturned face,
with its manly features and fair short-curling beard, softened
visibly beneath her glance, the Queen might well leave her
hand in her subject’s for an instant longer than the customs
of a court required. He looked like a man who had both
strength and will to help a woman at her need; and the bold
border chief kissed the white hand that lay so gently in his
own, with all the devotion of a worshipper kneeling before a
saint.</p>

<p>‘You are welcome, Bothwell,’ said Mary, ‘though you come,
doubtless, to tell me of fresh disturbances on the border&mdash;fresh
troubles to harass and perplex the Queen. The true heart
and ready hand grow rare at Holyrood, and more and more
welcome to Mary Stuart day by day.’</p>

<p>‘I am but a plain soldier, madam,’ answered Bothwell.
‘Your Majesty’s need of me is at once my pride and my reward.
It is nothing new to tell you that every drop of James
Hepburn’s blood belongs to his Queen.’</p>

<p>‘I believe it,’ answered Mary, smiling sadly; ‘and yet even
Bothwell’s loyalty has this very morning been questioned.
Nay,’ she added, as the Earl started indignantly to his feet,
‘I, at least, never doubted you for an instant.’</p>

<p>‘I have but one answer to my accusers, madam,’ replied
the warden, pointing significantly to his sword. ‘If a subject
questions my loyalty, I can demand the ordeal. If my
sovereign suspects it,’ he added, with a slight trembling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
his voice, ‘I can but give her my life to vindicate my
honour.’</p>

<p>‘O Bothwell!’ exclaimed Mary, ‘would that all were
like you! I have none to counsel me; none in whom I can
trust; none to sympathise with me in my loneliness, a widow,
and a Queen. To-day, in my bereavement and my affliction,’
she added, reverting to the conduct of her courtiers, which
had so hurt and irritated her best feelings, ‘not one of them
had the decency to share in the mourning of their sovereign.
Even my warden comes before me in his ordinary attire, but
that is fairly excusable when it consists of corslet and head-piece
hacked and dinted in my service.’</p>

<p>‘Say not so, madam,’ answered Bothwell, pointing to a
sprig of willow worn in his basnet. ‘I gathered yon sprig
from the sallows that skirt its bank as I rode the water of
Roslin in the misty dawn. I could not forget the day of my
Queen’s bereavement; and it shall never be told that Bothwell
forbore to share the dangers or the sorrows of his sovereign.’</p>

<p>The angry colour that had brightened it all the morning
died out on Mary’s cheek. She looked at the Earl steadfastly
while one might have counted ten, then her lip quivered. She
turned her face away, and burst into tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘“To arms!” the citizens bellow&mdash;“Alack!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">These riders are loose in the town once more!”</div>
<div class="verse">But a good steel jack, and a friend to my back,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Causeway I’ll keep in the teeth of a score.</div>
<div class="verse">For never another can ruffle it here,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the lads of the snaffle, spur, and spear.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen Bothwell in his harness,&mdash;the loyal nobleman,
the true knight, the Warden of the Marches, and Lieutenant
of the Borders in the service of his Queen. A different
personage, in truth, from wild James Hepburn, with his father’s
hot blood rioting in his veins, and his own propensities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
evil, encouraged by a strong will and vigorous temperament,
acting on a bad education, a weak brain, and a heart with
just enough of good in it to make him lonely and unhappy.</p>

<p>Like his father, the profligate Earl Patrick, he was disposed
by nature to take a leading part in all scenes of turbulence
and strife; unlike that father, his better feelings would sometimes
be permitted to influence his policy, and weaken his
determination. Earl Patrick seems to have had a happy facility
of ignoring all promises, bonds, and even oaths, when their
observance became inconvenient, and would have scorned to
allow his patriotism to stand for an hour in the way of his
advancement. His son, with all his faults, was a Scotchman
at heart; and, perhaps, like many another whose fate has
served ‘to point a moral or adorn a tale,’ it wanted but the
difference of a hair’s breadth, at the right moment, to have
made him as good as he turned out evil. Perhaps Bothwell’s
real sphere was riding his war-horse in mail and plate amongst
the wild morasses of the marches. Perhaps he was never so
happy as when engaged in hand-to-hand conflict with some
daring marauder, a stalwart man-at-arms like himself&mdash;lance-thrust
and sword-stroke freely dealt and stoutly received with
but little ill-will on either side. Whilst his foe was in the saddle
he would close with him gallantly, striking fiercely, and
shouting, ‘Queen Mary!’ but, down upon the heather, the
adversary of a moment ago became the helpless friend, to be
set upon a horse and borne gently to Hermitage, there to be
tended carefully till his wounds were cured, when he should
be set free at a trifling ransom, to meet and fight it out
again.</p>

<p>’Twas a wild adventurous life that of a southern Scottish
nobleman in the days of the beautiful Stuart; yet not without
its pleasures and its charm. He lived in his old keep, a
petty monarch within his bounds, surrounded by adherents
who would not scruple to shed every drop of their blood in
the service of their chief. Bold, athletic, and self-reliant, he
held his sway by the charter of his sword; he gained his
revenues by the unfailing influence of ‘snaffle, spur, and
spear.’ For his relaxation, he leapt on a good horse, and cast
his hawk into the air, by the side of many a green nook and
fresh brawling stream, or holloaed his hounds on the slot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the flying deer, scouring over the moorland, and bruising the
fragrant heather beneath its hoofs. For the business of life,
the same good horse came round to the door, champing under
his steel frontlet, and the men-at-arms mustered on their
bonny bay geldings with laugh and jest, and loud anticipations
of plunder. The moon glinted coldly on steel jack and
burnished head-piece as they clattered off, and the morning
sun rose on the troop returning with its booty&mdash;driving jaded
cattle before them with their long lances&mdash;encumbered with
panting, footsore sheep&mdash;household plenishing on some of the
saddles&mdash;armour hacked and besmirched&mdash;two or three bloody
sconces beneath draggled plumes&mdash;and here and there a led
horse, coming masterless home.</p>

<p>But the life was at least one of manhood and adventure;
a good training for a soldier, and an invigorating substitute
for the debaucheries in which, under other circumstances,
these bold spirits would have been prone to indulge. When
a border noble, with his train, rode into Edinburgh, the
vintner hugged himself in his snow-white apron, and the
canny burgher made his doors fast ere it was yet twilight,
and resolved that no shouts for help on the causeway should
lure him at night from his chimney corner into the troubled
street.</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell, proceeding quietly up the High Street,
and ruminating, not too pleasantly, on his prospects, found
himself accosted by his new friend, ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ as
he was about to turn into his solitary lodging, and get
through the evening as well as he could, reflecting on two
unpleasant subjects&mdash;the continued coyness of his lady-love
and his own diminished fortunes, for his employment at the
Scottish court was more honourable than lucrative. To be
in love usually makes a man unsociable; to be in debt often
has a reverse effect. Maxwell, at all events, felt little disposed
for an evening spent in his own company.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been the length of Holyrood to see for you!’ exclaimed
the borderer with a boisterous welcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> ‘and here I
happen on you like a deer that’s ta’en the double when the
bloodhound is off the slot. Come away, man, come away;
the warden’s gotten a grand spread the night, an’ I was bid
to fetch ye, ’gin ye were in the Queen’s presence! And noo’,
ye’ll just gang in wi’ me; ye ken we’ve an awfu’ grip, we
Liddesdale lads! an’ I would like fine to see if ye can drink,
man, as well as ye can fight. I’m thinkin’ little Jock Elliott’s
no forgotten ye, Mr Maxwell!’ And Dick laughed heartily at
the recollection of his first acquaintance with his present
companion.</p>

<p>Maxwell professed his readiness to accept the Earl’s invitation,
and linking his arm in that of the stalwart henchman,
proceeded in the direction of Bothwell’s lodging, the
pair provoking no little ill-will from divers armed retainers in
the street, who recognised the cognisance of the Hepburn,
and some admiration from the maids and matrons of the Old
Town, the latter especially approving of Dick’s stalwart proportions
and comely, good-natured face.</p>

<p>‘Yon’s a proper man!’ observed a stout dame with her
arms a-kimbo, to a dishevelled and dirty lady, emptying a pail
of water scarcely more dirty than herself.</p>

<p>‘He’s no that ill,’ replied the other, desisting from her
operations to push back her tangled locks, that she might
have a good look. ‘Lass!’ she added in shrill, impressive
tones, ‘he’s a godless borderer. I ken them fine by their
’spauld-pieces.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He’ll get his licks the night, I’m thinkin’,
an muckle guid may they do till him! It’s no sae saft lyin’
on the causeway as doun amang the moss-hags at hame!’
After which ill-omened sentiment, she retired abruptly,
shutting her door with a bang.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Plates of steel that defended the arm and shoulder.</p>

</div>

<p>Honest Dick, however, took no notice of these and other
less unpleasant remarks, but strode boldly on, discoursing,
between bursts of merriment, on the encounter with little
Jock Elliott, an assault of which he seemed to entertain a
highly facetious remembrance.</p>

<p>‘In here, man,’ said he, turning up one of those offshoots
from the main street, which is termed to this day ‘a close,’
and dragging Maxwell after him with obvious glee. ‘I ken
the place fine by the weather-marks forenent the wa’. It’s
an awfu’ toon this, for a body to lose theirsel’! There’s
runnin’ water too to guide a man,’ pointing to a sluggish
stream of filth that trickled under their feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> ‘but it’s no
that clear that it is in Liddesdale. Up the stair, man; yer’
welcome, nae fears!’</p>

<p>As Maxwell entered the apartment, a long, low room, plainly
furnished and crowded with armed men, he was cordially
greeted by the earl’s retainers, who had mustered in great
force. They had seen his hand keep his head, against heavy
odds, and they warmed to him at once as a kindred nature.
Their meal seemed to be concluded, but the serious part of
the entertainment was yet to commence; and large jacks of
strong ale, with flasks of wine, standing at no great intervals
on the board, denoted ample means of quenching the thirst
engendered by a long ride. The warden rose to greet his
new guest with frank courtesy, and bade him to the upper
end of the room, where he himself sat at a cross table surrounded
by the most distinguished of his guests.</p>

<p>Bothwell had doffed his usual attire of steel jack and
head-piece; he was now dressed in close-fitting doublet and
hose, which set off the strong proportions of his figure to
great advantage. Without pretensions to strict personal
beauty, the warden had fine features, and a bold, frank
bearing, not unpleasing. Though he had lost one of his
eyes in a skirmish, the defect was scarcely observable,
and the slight scar, left by the wound on his cheek and eyebrow,
rather added to the characteristic expression of his face.
It was that of a daring, perhaps a reckless man, one who
was inured to danger and used to strife; yet was there something
soft and even tender in his smile. Flushed with wine,
and exchanging broad jests of the coarsest with his laughing
guests, he looked a fitting leader in a revel or a charge; and
yet a close observer would have detected a hollow ring in the
loud laugh, a false note in the jovial strain, a capability for
better things than feasting and fighting, and a self-accusing
consciousness that it was lost and thrown away.</p>

<p>The mirth was at its highest. If Bothwell was splendidly
dressed, his costume was but sombre when compared with
that of his princely guest, the Marquis d’Elbœuf, who shone
with satin and jewellery in all the florid brilliancy of French
decoration. If the warden’s draughts were deep, and his
toasts objectionable, the Lords John and Robert Stuart, the
Queen’s half-brothers, pledged him freely and out-talked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
shamelessly, with a happy mixture of juvenile thirst and
royal audacity. When Maxwell took his seat at the upper
table, amidst these and two or three more of the wilder
gallants of the Court, the wine had circulated freely, and the
spirits of the party had risen to that point at which discretion
ceases to interfere, and reason begins to discover that
she has been all day in the wrong. D’Elbœuf flung himself
into the spirit of the scene with the keen zest of his nation.
The Admiral of France was the last man to refuse a challenge
from friend or foe.</p>

<p>‘You shall pledge me in turn, Bothwell,’ said he, filling a
large silver measure with wine. ‘Every man of you shall do
me reason. These wild lads, who ought to be nephews of
my own, and who drink as if they were grandsons of Charlemagne;
Mr Maxwell, there, who has just come in, and must
be suffocated with thirst; your huge squire of the body, who
might hold a cask; and all your gentlemen riders, rovers on
land, as their chief used to be at sea. What, Count Bothwell!
We have not forgotten the breeze off shore, and the
bold Norwegian coast.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, Marquis,’ answered Bothwell, filling himself a
bumper, ‘my Liddesdale lads will drink any toast you please,
if they like the liquor. But down on the marches we have
a saying that “he who rides in the dark should dismount
before daylight,” and faith, now that I am on shore, I have
forgotten all about the coast of Norway and the wild North
Sea, once for all.’</p>

<p>‘The toast! the toast!’ exclaimed Lord John Stuart.
‘Let us have the drink first, marquis, and the tale of the
warden’s wicked doings afterwards. There’s something in
this wine that makes a man marvellously thirsty.’</p>

<p>‘Waifs and strays!’ replied the marquis, holding his
beaker above his head. ‘Count Bothwell first taught me
the rights of an admiral on neutral seas. Pledge me,
gentlemen; the toast is quite in your own line.’ And
d’Elbœuf, laughingly heartily, set his cup on the board&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>A dark flush swept over Bothwell’s brow. A man does
not always like to be reminded of his past exploits, but the
company were clamorous for an explanation of the Frenchma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>n’s
toast, and d’Elbœuf had drunk too much wine to disappoint
them.</p>

<p>‘We were lying off the coast of Norway,’ said the admiral,
‘and our host here in his armed galliot, with the Lion of
Scotland at the main, was never tired of cruising about in
search of adventures. He was Admiral of Scotland, as I of
France; but whilst I waited for fortune, I think he followed
the jade and grasped her by the hair. Some pirates had
fired a village and were carrying off the inhabitants, when
your warden here caught the knaves, red-handed, in the bay;&mdash;we
make short work with these gentry at sea, where ropes
are so convenient, and he strung them up to the yard-arm
by dozens, like Normandy apples on a tree. The poor
captives were too rejoiced to go back to the ashes of their
dwellings; but a breeze springing up from the land, our
friend here was obliged to make sail, carrying off, inadvertently,
two or three trifles belonging to the village; amongst
others, a fair girl with blue eyes and golden hair, who had
once inhabited the principal house. I was on board the
galliot some six weeks afterwards at an entertainment given
by our host, where we drank nearly as much wine as we are
like to do to-night, and this fair lass filled my cup and
emptied her own, nothing loth, as though she relished her
wine and her company. “But shall you not send her back?”
said I to my host, seeing that she had been already six weeks
on board. “Shall you not send her back before her friends
lose patience and a complaint is made at Court, and a coil,
all for a pair of merry eyes and a wisp of yellow hair?” “Not
yet,” answered your warden. “Not yet. Do you not know
that waifs and strays belong to the admiral?”’</p>

<p>A loud laugh followed d’Elbœuf’s explanation. The
sentiment was quite in accordance with the company, and
the point of his narrative, turning as it did on an act of
illegal appropriation, was hugely enjoyed by the carousing
borderers.</p>

<p>There were two exceptions, however, to the general merriment.
Bothwell looked grave, more sorrowful, perhaps, than
displeased; and honest ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ smiting a sledgehammer
fist on the table that made the beakers leap again,
burst out&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Puir lassie! It’s ill liftin’ a bairn from the ingle, or a
lamb from the fauld!’</p>

<p>The wine was, by this time, producing its effect on the
company. The men-at-arms were beginning to flush and talk
thick, descanting, without much regard for listeners, on the
merits of their horses and their own prowess, both in fighting
and carrying off the property of their neighbours; the latter
branch of their profession being obviously esteemed equally
honourable with, and the natural prelude to, or consequence
of, the former. Even Maxwell’s brain was somewhat heated;
albeit, he was naturally of a temperament on which wine is
slow to take effect, and his late arrival had spared him some
of the pledges of the borderers; although, to do them justice,
they evinced a most hospitable desire to make up for lost time.
Bothwell, too, who had been plunged in gloomy fits of abstraction,
and who seemed to rouse himself with difficulty from
some engrossing subject of meditation, was now getting as
hilarious as the rest. D’Elbœuf was full of smiles and spirits,
and scraps of French songs, somewhat wasted on his audience;
whilst Lord John, whose ruling passion was of course in the
ascendant, proposed gravely to dance a measure amongst the
jugs and drinking cups on the table, and actually mounted a
chair as the first step towards that difficult performance.</p>

<p>At this juncture, a ray of moonlight streaming through the
narrow windows, athwart the glare of lamps and torches, gave
a new turn to the impulses of the merry-makers.</p>

<p>‘It’ll be a bra’ night this in Liddesdale,’ observed ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’
who was given to sentiment in his cups.</p>

<p>‘A rare night for a foray!’ exclaimed Lord Robert, producing
from the interior of his bonnet two or three black
velvet masks, such as were then frequently worn in cities by
both sexes.</p>

<p>‘Shall we have a cruise, admiral?’ said Bothwell. ‘I
doubt not I can find you in vizards, for you and I are both
well enough known in Edinburgh to meet fewer friends than
foes.’</p>

<p>D’Elbœuf agreed cordially to the proposal. Like his countrymen
in general, he was averse to continuous hard-drinking,
and a night of adventure in the town was more to his taste
than a steady carouse with these inexhaustible borderers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
His host, too, appeared in the restless mood of a man who
has some secret pain goading him to action. The more he
drank, the fiercer seemed to grow the impulse to be doing.
When the arch-tempter wants a tool that shall be at once keen
and strong, he takes a bold vigorous nature; he humbles it in
its own eyes; he wounds it in its best affections; he whispers,
‘do to others as <em>they have done</em> unto you;’ then he tempers
it in the furnace of memory, and sharpens it carefully on
the grindstone of remorse; finally, he steeps it in rough
strong wine; after that, it is fit for anything, and will cut
through steel harness and muslin fold with vindictive impartiality.</p>

<p>Masks for the party were soon produced in sufficient number,
and these, with their cloaks or plaids, would be disguise
enough in the event of the night’s amusement growing to a
breach of the laws, such being, by no means, an unlikely result.
The warden desired his retainers to sit still and continue
drinking till his return&mdash;directions with which they showed
no unwillingness to comply; but as the masked party, brandishing
their torches, shouting, singing, and laughing, descended
the stair into the close, ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ whispered
to Maxwell to get his sword and accompany him.</p>

<p>‘There’ll be mair pows than ane crackit the night, or all’s
done,’ remarked the borderer. ‘The warden’s no canny when
he’s crossit. Aince the whingars be oot, I’m no thinkin’
muckle o’ yon’ Frenchman, an’ thae wild lads is clean wud
wi’ drink. We’ll be nane the waur o’ a decent body like
yoursel’, Mr Maxwell, just to strike in an’ see fair play.’</p>

<p>With the exception of a slight delay in the close, to witness
Lord John’s performance of his promised hornpipe, the effect
of which was somewhat marred by the gutter traversing the
pavement, nothing occurred to check the progress of the
rioters. Save for themselves, the street lay utterly quiet and
deserted in the cold moonlight. The party, linking arms,
reeled and swaggered on, followed, at no long interval, by
‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ and Maxwell, both tolerably sober.</p>

<p>Presently, Bothwell halted at the door of the only house
from which lights were shining.</p>

<p>‘What say you, gentlemen?’ laughed the warden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> ‘I
know Master Craig, the mercer, well. It seems that he is
expecting us. Shall we go in and take our rere-supper with
pretty Mistress Alison, his daughter?’</p>

<p>‘By all means!’ exclaimed d’Elbœuf. ‘The best dressed
damsel that walks the High Street on Sundays. I should
know her anywhere by the orange stripes on her farthingale.’</p>

<p>‘And the bonniest lass on Leith Sands at the merry-making
to-day,’ added Lord Robert. ‘I little thought when I gave
her her fairings this morning, I should sup with her to-night!’</p>

<p>‘The neatest foot and the tightest stocking in the Old
Town,’ said Lord John, ‘and the best dancer to boot. Knock
at the door, Bothwell, and bid them let us in, in the devil’s
name!’</p>

<p>Concealing themselves under the wall of the house, the
party waited, with much stifled merriment, the result of
Bothwell’s application for admittance.</p>

<p>His cautious knock was at first unanswered, but on repetition,
the light was observed to be obscured at one of the windows,
and a female head, scarcely so well arranged as that of
Mistress Alison herself, was thrust into the moonlight, the
owner demanding, in a guarded whisper, ‘What’s your wull?’</p>

<p>‘Go down and unbar the door,’ answered Bothwell, in like
tones of secrecy, and pulling his mask carefully over his face.
‘We have come to sup with your mistress.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the earl!’ the girl was heard to say, turning round
obviously to hold parley with some one in the room; and then
another voice whispered in softer tones, ‘Is it you, my lord?’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course it is!’ answered Bothwell, somewhat surprised,
nevertheless, that he should be so easily recognised.</p>

<p>‘I have expected you this hour and more,’ was the reply,
as the two figures moved at once from the window.</p>

<p>‘The devil you have!’ observed the warden, now completely
puzzled; ‘then why don’t you come down and open
the door?’</p>

<p>Presently bars were heard to be withdrawn, and the party
of rioters, if we may so term them, marshalled themselves in
close order, prepared, if necessary, to go in with a rush. The
door, however, was only partially unclosed, and the figure of
a strapping serving-wench guarded the narrow interstice. She
seemed less satisfied than her mistress, and inclined to hold
further parley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Hoo will I ken it’s you?’ said she, shading the candle
with her large coarse hand.</p>

<p>But the caution was too late. Lord John’s shoulder was
by this time applied to the door. Lord Robert blew out the
candle, and the Admiral of France, with characteristic gallantry
and national politeness, stifled the outcry of the astonished
damsel in the dark.</p>

<p>The assailants had now gained the body of the place, still
keeping their masks on, and with noiseless footsteps they
ascended the stair; Maxwell and ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ who
had neither of them much stomach for the adventure, remaining
at the door to keep watch.</p>

<p>The others turned into a comfortable parlour in which fire
and lights were burning, as if to make them thoroughly at
home. A delicate little supper, with a flask or two of wine,
stood on the table, and a very smartly dressed lady, not
without beauty of a bold, imposing style, rose to welcome
them.</p>

<p>As Bothwell entered, this gaudy-looking dame seemed about
to rush into his arms, but observing that he did not remove
his mask, and was accompanied by three or four others, she
checked herself, and remained standing in the middle of the
room as if not altogether mistress of the position.</p>

<p>The warden, bowing low, advanced to take her hand, and
Mistress Alison suffered him to do so, with an expression of
ludicrous uncertainty on her handsome face.</p>

<p>‘Will you not unmask, my lord?’ said she; ‘though late,
you are welcome, and so are your friends. Why did you
bring them with you?’ she added, in a troubled whisper.</p>

<p>It was impossible to carry on the deception any longer;
and by this time the laughter of the party had been so long
smothered as to defy further restraint. With many apologies
and courtly compliments and honeyed phrases, interrupted by
bursts of merriment, one and all unmasked, disclosing to the
bewildered Mistress Alison the features of quite another earl
from her expected guest, and of three or four of the wildest
gallants at Holyrood, with whom, nevertheless, she was not
entirely unacquainted.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful qualities in woman is her pliant
nature, her tendency to adapt herself to circumstances, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
readiness with which, in the absence of white bread, she
contents herself with brown. Of this amiable facility the
mercer’s daughter now afforded a striking instance. Bidden
or unbidden, <em>here</em> were the gallants,&mdash;good-looking, amusing,
and well-dressed; and <em>there</em> was the supper. Mistress Alison
did not hesitate long.</p>

<p>‘You will not depart without breaking bread,’ said she,
pointing to the well-covered table, with courteous hospitality.</p>

<p>Lord Robert filled himself a bumper on the spot.</p>

<p>‘Pledge us, fair Mistress Alison!’ said he; ‘a cup of wine
will restore the bloom to that damask cheek, paled with the
alarm of our sudden arrival.’</p>

<p>The lady drank and smiled. It is but fair to observe that,
notwithstanding his lordship’s polite fiction, the ‘damask
cheek’ had never paled, nor Mistress Alison lost her presence
of mind for an instant. Perhaps she was not entirely unused
to these impromptu supper-parties.</p>

<p>Merrily they sat down, heaping their cloaks, and swords,
and masks in the corner of the room, their hostess only
stipulating against too much noise, and insisting that her
guests should not disturb the repose of the honest mercer who
slept above.</p>

<p>Mistress Alison seemed tolerably familiar with the private
history of her company, and the general gossip of the Court.
As she displayed the turn of her round arm, and close-fitting
bodice, while filling plates and drinking-cups, she had a jeer,
or a sarcasm, or a compliment for each. She congratulated
d’Elbœuf on the conquest he had made of her serving-woman,
who, never having seen a live Frenchman before, gazed at the
admiral open-mouthed. She twitted the two Stuarts with
their approaching bondage that should put an end to all such
midnight pranks.</p>

<p>‘For,’ said Mistress Alison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> ‘in less than a week, ye’ll both
be dancing in fetters to the tune of “Wooed and married an’
a’,” and the bonny brides will have gotten the two most graceless
gallants in Scotland for their grooms; and as sure as
death, I’ll see the wedding, if I creep into the palace through
the buttery window! Ay, my Lord Bothwell! you’re bold
riders, you Hepburns; but the bonny lass that thinks to tame
wild John Stuart, is the boldest amongst you all. Well, well!
it’s a good steed that’ll gallop till dawn. Once she gets into
the saddle, she’ll daunton<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> him, never fear!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Daunton, to tame; or familiarly, to cow&mdash;from the French <i>dompter</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>A loud laugh rewarded this sally at the expense of the
young noblemen, who were indeed making the most of their
remaining hours of freedom; and Lord John, who was about
to marry Bothwell’s sister, was so delighted with the conversation,
that he took Mistress Alison’s hand and proposed that
they should dance a measure together on the spot.</p>

<p>But the lady had no intention that her agreeable visitors
should remain for too long a period. In the midst of her
mirth she had never entirely got rid of a certain air of apprehension,
and twice or thrice she had stopped in the middle of
a sentence as if to listen. All at once she turned pale, <em>really</em>
pale this time, and set her goblet down untasted.</p>

<p>‘For any sake! my lord,’ she exclaimed, with an imploring
look at Bothwell, ‘go your ways now. I can let you down
the back stair. Go your ways, gentlemen, I entreat you, or
there will be blood spilt before all’s done!’</p>

<p>Already the tramp of feet and altercation of voices had been
heard in the street; now the clink of steel fell familiarly on
the ears of the guests up-stairs. They rose to their feet, and
commenced buckling on their swords simultaneously.</p>

<p>‘We are, indeed, fortunate,’ observed d’Elbœuf in high
glee; ‘a jovial carouse, a delightful supper-party, and a midnight
fray, all without the slightest trouble or inconvenience.’</p>

<p>‘For the love of mercy, begone!’ pleaded Mistress Alison,
pushing them, one after another, to the door. ‘For <em>my</em> sake,
for <em>any</em> sake, for <em>all</em> our sakes! They’re breaking in the
door! They’re coming up the stair! It’s the earl; as sure
as death, it’s the earl!’</p>

<p>‘What earl?’ laughed Bothwell, carelessly, and yet curious
to know the name of the favoured nobleman, for whom the
supper they had just eaten was prepared.</p>

<p>‘The Earl of Arran, of course!’ replied Mistress Alison,
blushing through her tears. ‘It’s too late now, for their
swords are out and their blood up, and the street full of the
red-handed Hamiltons! What will I do? What will I do?’</p>

<p>Pending further measures, Mistress Alison covered her head
with her mantle and cried piteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Bothwell smiled grimly in his beard when he heard the
name of Arran. They were none of the best of friends, the
Hepburns and the Hamiltons, at any time. To-night, the
warden’s heart thrilled with a fierce pleasure at the thought
of crossing swords with their chieftain’s son.</p>

<p>‘Draw, gentlemen,’ exclaimed Bothwell, putting himself at
the head of the party. ‘A Hepburn! a Hepburn to the
rescue! draw, and follow me!’</p>

<p>Thus shouting, he rushed to the stair-head, followed by his
friends, who appeared, one and all, as ready for the fray as
they had proved themselves for the feast.</p>

<p>The door had, indeed, been broken open, but the narrow
entrance was still filled, and stoutly defended by the stalwart
figure of the warden’s henchman. Though the odds were
fearfully against him, his great strength and familiarity with
his weapon had enabled him to make a gallant defence against
the assailants, who were closing round him. At the first alarm
(and the borderer’s quick ear had caught the step of armed
men approaching, long before they came in sight) he had
entreated Maxwell to return for the assistance of his comrades,
who were sure to be found still carousing in Bothwell’s
lodging. That gentleman used his own discretion in preferring
to turn out the city-guard; but of this intention the other was
ignorant. ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ never doubted he could keep
the door single-handed till assistance should arrive.</p>

<p>Thrust and blow and parry succeeded each other with fearful
rapidity. The borderer was long of limb and in capital
wind; moreover, his heart was as true as the steel in his
hand; but three or four to one will beat the best of swordsmen,
and he was overpowered at last, and driven back towards
the stair.</p>

<p>At this crisis a desperate charge of fresh combatants, led
by Bothwell from above, came opportunely to the rescue. It
cleared the hall and the door, which was instantaneously
closed and barred by the ready-witted serving-woman. Assailants
and assailed now found themselves carrying on the
combat in the street.</p>

<p>The skirmish became general. The Hamiltons mustered
in force, and came swarming to the assistance of their kinsmen.
Bothwell’s riders, too disturbed from their carouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
arrived by twos and threes, and the superiority of their
arms and training made them formidable partisans. Inured,
as all Scotchmen were in those days, to blows and bloodshed,
strife was the natural element of the borderer, and, drunk
or sober, he was always ready for a fight.</p>

<p>The Old Town was soon disturbed from its repose&mdash;peaceful
citizens leaped from their beds, and ran to the windows;
night-capped heads were thrust out into the moonlight, to
watch the tumult in the street below, as it waved backwards
and forwards in the vicissitudes of the struggle. There was
but little outcry; for men’s passions were thoroughly aroused,
and they were fighting to the death. Sometimes a hollow
groan, or a heavy fall on the stones, contrasted dully with
the scuffle of feet and the clash of steel. Sometimes a fierce
oath accompanied a shrewder blow than common, or a deadly
thrust that had been driven desperately home; but there
were few shots exchanged, and in the hand-to-hand conflict,
the Hamiltons were gradually losing ground.</p>

<p>Once Bothwell succeeded in reaching his enemy, and exchanged
a couple of passes with Arran; but the Hamiltons
rallied round their chieftain’s son, and the warden, grinding
his teeth with rage, was compelled to forego his revenge.</p>

<p>Several wounded, and more than one corpse, encumbered
the street; the fray was getting serious, and even ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
seemed to think it was an affair more of business
than pleasure, when the common bell began to toll loudly,
and the city-guard, guided by Walter Maxwell, and commanded
by no less a personage than Lord James Stuart himself,
made its appearance on the scene.</p>

<p>These hardy burghers, well-armed, and confident in the
sympathies, and, if necessary, the assistance of the townsfolk,
thrust themselves boldly between the combatants; Lord
James, on whose thoughtful brow could be traced no more
excitement than ordinary, himself striking up the weapons of
either party, as he bade them lay down their arms in the
Queen’s name.</p>

<p>Bothwell had just reached Arran for the second time.
The warden’s eye glared wickedly and the froth was white
on his moustache. Arran, pale as death, and with madness
flaring in his looks, struggled to meet his enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
shouting wildly and incoherently in a paroxysm of insanity.</p>

<p>Their swords had actually crossed when Lord James struck
in between. His face was calm and unmoved; nay, there
was a lurking satisfaction in his eye, for, to the plotting diplomatist,
there is always gain in the differences of the powerful;
but to-night it was Lord James’s cue rather to stifle
than foment such dissensions, and he wished also to stand
well with the citizens by quelling a disturbance that had
alarmed the town.</p>

<p>‘For shame, gentlemen,’ said he, beating down their
weapons with the sheathed sword. ‘For shame! you,
Arran, her near kinsman; and you, Bothwell, in whom she
trusts. What will the Queen say when she hears of it?’</p>

<p>The red blood faded from the warden’s angry brow at
Mary Stuart’s name, and sinking the point of his sword, he
fell back with a look of deep shame and contrition. In his
fiercest moments that spell was sufficient to make him docile
as a child.</p>

<p>Not so Arran. With a wild shriek of rage, he darted a
savage thrust at the peace-maker, that, had it taken effect,
might have spared Scotland much bloodshed and Mary
Stuart many a tear, for her wily bastard-brother would never
have moved again. It was not fated, however, to reach its
object; for ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’s’ quick eye caught the
movement, and he parried it with a force and rapidity that
shivered Arran’s blade in pieces, and beat it from his hand.
His retainers now gathered round their leader, and forced
him from the ground, the unfortunate maniac raving and
writhing in their grasp.</p>

<p>Bothwell, too, got his men in order, and withdrew them,
submitting patiently to the rebukes of Lord James. It is
needless to observe, that on the first appearance of their
grave brother, the Lords John and Robert had taken to
flight, closely followed by d’Elbœuf, who did not wish to
figure as a brawler at his niece’s court. The warden alone
remained to bear the blame, and, now that the excitement
had cooled, he bitterly regretted what he had done.</p>

<p>As he was followed by his henchman, Lord James called
the latter back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Let me look in your face, good fellow,’ said he; ‘you
have saved my life to-night.’</p>

<p>‘The redder’s lick is aye the warst in the fray,’ answered
the other, good-humouredly; ‘and doubtless your honour
was no takin’ notice, and it must have gone clean through
ye,’ he added, dogmatically.</p>

<p>‘You have saved my life,’ repeated Lord James. ‘I leave
no scores unpaid for, good or evil, and if ever the time should
come, I shall not forget the debt I owe you.’</p>

<p>But ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ shook his head doubtfully. ‘I’m
no sae dooms sure o’ that,’ said he, as he strode on after his
chief. ‘An’ I wad like ill to be beholden to a man that
could part sic a bonny fray. Oh, man!’ he added to Maxwell,
who had now joined him, ‘what garred ye bring in the
burgher-guard? The drink was just dyin’ out in our lads,
and we wad ha’ gotten the grandest ploy I’ve seen sin’ I cam’
out of Carlisle jail.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Away! away! thou traitor strang!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Out of my sicht soon mayst thou be!</div>
<div class="verse">I granted never a traitor grace,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And now I’ll not begin with thee.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was with no agreeable feelings, that Maxwell received a
summons to attend the Council at Holyrood the morning
after the fray. Ere he had well slept off the fatigues and
dissipation of the previous night, he was disturbed by a pursuivant
in the royal livery, with the lion emblazoned on his
surcoat, who required his immediate presence at the palace,
and from whose rigid sense of duty he found it difficult to
extort permission to summon ‘Dick-o’-the Cleugh’ as a witness
in his favour.</p>

<p>Maxwell reflected that the borderer’s straightforward testimony
would serve to exonerate him from any share in the
disturbance, except the measures which put a stop to it; and
by dint of argument, remonstrance, and a bonnet-piece or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
two, he succeeded in sending a message to Bothwell himself,
who, for reasons of his own, was only too ready to despatch
his henchman in reply.</p>

<p>As they proceeded together towards the palace, attended
by the pursuivant and four stout men-at-arms, ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
could by no means be brought to consider their past
broil in the light of a breach of the peace. On the contrary,
he esteemed it from beginning to end as the simple and natural
consequence of a jaunt to the capital, and was fully persuaded
that their present expedition must result in a vote of praise to
all concerned.</p>

<p>Yet the borderer’s iron nerves seemed affected as they
entered the precincts of the Abbey. He was unusually restless,
and glanced hither and thither, as though in expectation.
Certain female tones in the garden by no means restored his
composure; and while Maxwell, with a thrill of offended pride,
that was yet longing to forgive, recognised Mary Carmichael’s
well-known voice, Dick nudged him vigorously with his elbow,
and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Ye’ll hae to speak up for the twae o’ us, Mr Maxwell. I
was aye dashed wi’ the women-folk; an’ it’s like they’ll no let
us away the day without gettin’ a sight o’ the Queen and her
leddies. Man, I would like fine to see them in their braws!’</p>

<p>Ere Walter could reply, a gentleman-usher beckoned him
silently to advance, while two stout men-at-arms, crossing
their axes in front of his follower, gave ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
to understand he must wait till he was sent for. Unusual
vigilance seemed to pervade the palace. The guard was
doubled on the staircase and in the galleries, whilst a strong
body of cavalry occupied the court.</p>

<p>As Maxwell’s conductors halted at the door of the council-chamber,
the former felt his wonted composure sadly disturbed
by the appearance of Mary Carmichael, who was crossing
from the garden towards the Queen’s apartments. She
started and blushed vividly when she met his eye, and then,
observing him to be under escort, turned pale with obvious
apprehension. She stopped, too, as if she would fain speak
with him; but after an imploring glance that seemed to
entreat his forgiveness, and assure him of her sympathy,
hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>So strangely constituted is the human mind, even in those
who most pride themselves on their philosophy, that Maxwell
felt his heart lighter than it had been for a week, and entered
the awful presence of the council without the slightest appearance
of dismay; and yet he had not exchanged a syllable
with her, had only caught her eye for an instant, and heard
the rustle of her garments as she passed. Surely there is
some strange magic in our nature that works below the surface,
and encircles the bravest and the strongest in its spells.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, which Maxwell now entered,
stood a massive oak table, covered with papers and parchments,
prepared for the sign-manual of Mary Stuart. Around
it were seated those Scottish noblemen whose turn it was to
assist the deliberations of their sovereign, thwarting indeed the
free-will, and impeding her resolutions, yet constituting and
considering themselves the trusty advisers of the crown.</p>

<p>The Duke of Chatelhérault, in right of his high rank and
royal lineage, acted as president; and on his noble brow might
be traced an expression of puzzled vexation as he followed in
vain Secretary Maitland’s rapid and masterly explanation of
the business in hand. That astute diplomatist, carrying his
colleagues triumphantly with him, was furnishing a brilliant
display of rhetorical fireworks, to prove that the measure he
now advocated (which had indeed for its object the placing of
additional power in Lord James Stuart’s hands) was the only
possibility of saving the country; and the haughty Hamilton,
dazzled rather than enlightened by his eloquence, looked as
dissatisfied as a man generally does who is ‘convinced against
his will.’</p>

<p>The Queen’s brother had assumed a modest and deprecating
air, as who should say, ‘I seek not authority, but only wish
rigidly to fulfil the duties that are thrust upon me’&mdash;a sentiment
he had already expressed to the council when they sat
down. The others listened in different attitudes of attention
or approval, according as their interests or their convictions
led them to agree with the speaker; whilst Mary herself,
whose chair was drawn a little apart from the table, looked
up from her embroidery ever and anon in the face of her half-brother,
with an expression of perfect confidence and affection.
Though her noble intellect might detect many a flaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in her secretary’s arguments, she was too thoroughly a woman
not to be a <em>dishonest reasoner</em>; and of all the intriguers who
backed Lord James in his efforts at supreme power, none supported
him so fearlessly and confidingly as the Queen.</p>

<p>David Riccio sat, so to speak, under her Majesty’s wing.
His evident favour with his mistress extorted for him a certain
outward deference and cold civility from the nobles; but he
was already inclined to put himself too forward, without reflecting
that the key of a lady’s <i>escritoire</i> is but a frail weapon
to meet a two-handed sword, and a velvet doublet a poor
defence against the blow of a dudgeon-dagger.</p>

<p>When Maxwell was admitted, the State Secretary had just
concluded his peroration, and was shuffling his papers together
on the table with an air of business-like satisfaction. He
looked up at this new arrival, however, with calm indifference,
and spreading a blank sheet of paper before him, appeared
ready to enter at once upon a new affair with fresh energy
and attention.</p>

<p>Lord Ruthven, whose temper was none of the sweetest, and
whose liking for the warden was of that kind which would
fain have had a yard and a half of green turf, and the same
measure of cold steel, between them, scowled upon Bothwell’s
kinsman with all the ferocity of which his stern features were
capable&mdash;a compliment returned by Maxwell with a stare of
undaunted defiance. Morton stole a rapid and sinister glance
at the Queen, while his beard curled with his habitual sneering
smile. Huntly, Argyle, and the rest, settled themselves
into comfortable attitudes, as though the more important business
of the morning were now disposed of.</p>

<p>The Duke of Chatelhérault, as the aggrieved person, was
the first to speak. With a haughty affectation of indifference,
he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Who is this witness? Is he of gentle birth?’</p>

<p>And being informed by Maitland that he was a kinsman
of Earl Bothwell, his Grace replied, indignantly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘An impartial witness ye have brought before the council!
Why not examine the earl himself? if, indeed, he acknowledges
any authority but border-law. It is well that the Hamiltons
can right themselves with their own good swords.’</p>

<p>Maitland cut short his further objections by desiring Maxwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to proceed with his account of the fray, while the Queen
looked up from her work as if about to expostulate, but
checked herself with a half-smothered sigh.</p>

<p>Maxwell told his tale simply and frankly. It was obvious
that the fray had originated in a brawl begun by the Hamiltons,
who had insisted on forcing their way into Mistress
Alison’s house. Seeing that bloodshed was unavoidable, he
had hurried off to alarm the civic guard, leaving the earl’s
henchman at the door. When he returned, the skirmish, as
Lord James could corroborate, was at its height. The henchman
could speak to what took place during the narrator’s
absence; he had craved permission to bring him to Holyrood
for that purpose.</p>

<p>His manly, straightforward evidence seemed to make a
favourable impression on the council. Maitland looked up
from his notes, and, glancing at the duke for approval, desired
the borderer to be summoned.</p>

<p>Honest Dick entered the council-chamber with an undaunted
front, till he caught sight of the Queen, when he blushed up
to his ears, and made a profound and exceedingly awkward
obeisance. Then he looked about as if in search of something,
and finally stood bolt upright, like a man prepared to
be ‘shot at.’</p>

<p>‘Your name?’ said the duke, haughtily.</p>

<p>Dick reflected a few moments, and then answered, with the
air of one who makes an admission under protest&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh.’</p>

<p>‘Your calling?’ added the president, severely.</p>

<p>‘Just a rider,’ answered Dick, after another pause.</p>

<p>The nobles glanced significantly at each other, and Huntly
observed, with a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>‘That is another word for thief in your country, is it not?’</p>

<p>Dick looked extremely demure and unconscious, as he
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Na, it’s broken men they ca’ thieves on the border&mdash;just
like Catherans an’ Gordons an’ that in the North.’</p>

<p>The council could not forbear a laugh, and even the Queen
bent over her work to conceal her amusement.</p>

<p>‘Faith, Huntly, he shivered his lance fairly against thy
breastplate this time,’ said Lord Seton; and Huntly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
throwing his portly person back in his chair, vowed good-humouredly
that the definition was a sufficiently precise one
at either extremity of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The borderer’s examination then proceeded.</p>

<p>‘Was it by your chief’s orders that you defended the door
in the High Street last night?’</p>

<p>‘I took nae orders yestre’en frae the warden,’ replied Dick,
‘forbye to see to the naigs about our back-coming.’</p>

<p>‘Would you have ventured to draw upon the Earl of Arran&mdash;upon
my son,’ asked the duke, ‘without your chief’s express
commands to slay him if you came across him?’</p>

<p>‘I ken your Grace fine,’ answered the borderer, not very
directly, ‘seein’ you’re the grandest nobleman in Scotland;
but if yon was the Earl of Arran, an’ a’ your Grace’s blood
fight like yon camsteary chiel, I wad like ill to keep the
causeway anither nicht frae the Hamiltons.’</p>

<p>‘What was the origin of the disturbance?’ here interposed
Secretary Maitland, seeing that the discussion produced no
obvious results. ‘Who began the brawl, man, and first bared
steel?’</p>

<p>‘I could not say,’ replied Dick, looking profoundly ignorant.
‘I’m thinkin’ the stramash was a’ in gude fellowship,
till his honour here, the Lord James, an’ the city guard struck
in an’ spoilt all.’</p>

<p>‘Why, you yourself were at half-sword with a score of
them when I came up,’ said Lord James, laughing, in spite of
himself, at the borderer’s coolness.</p>

<p>‘Oo! that was just a ploy!’ answered Dick, with a grin
of delight at the recollection. ‘I’ve seen waur licks than
yon gi’en an’ ta’en in Bewcastle Markit, just for gude-will ye
ken, an’ a tass or twa o’ brandy.’</p>

<p>‘Let him go,’ said the duke, ‘till we send for him again.
It is not against this faithful knave, your Majesty and my
lords, that I appeal for justice, but against the Earl of
Bothwell.’</p>

<p>Again Morton shot a lurid glance at the Queen, whose
white fingers were travelling fast to and fro through her
embroidery.</p>

<p>‘The earl had entered the house peacefully enough when
I left,’ began Maxwell, but he was sternly and peremptorily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
commanded to hold his peace, whilst a whispered consultation
was carried on by the chief nobility present, in which Lord
James alone took no part.</p>

<p>The Queen, with an angry spot on each cheek, continued
to work very fast.</p>

<p>‘It is but a part of the plot against Her Majesty’s person,’
said the duke, after a while, ‘a plot which my son himself
has discovered, and which on his recovery he will prove on
the Earl of Bothwell’s body with his blade. Meantime, there
lies my glove; if the Hepburn has a friend, let him take it
up!’</p>

<p>Maxwell interposed, eagerly.</p>

<p>‘To any one of my own degree,’ he began&mdash;but an imploring
glance from the Queen at her brother had roused that
statesman from his apathy, and he interfered.</p>

<p>‘Take back your glove, my Lord Duke!’ said he. ‘This
is no affair of private brawl, but a matter in which the safety
of the crown is involved. My lords, I move for a committee
of inquiry on the spot.’</p>

<p>The duke bit his glove through, ere he replaced it on his
hand, and then, with moody brow and angry eye, listened in
silence to the conference.</p>

<p>‘I move that James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, be committed
to ward till such time as he can purge himself from
the charges brought against him by the Earl of Arran,’ said
Lord Ruthven, after another brief consultation, with a smile
of triumph on his pale, gaunt face.</p>

<p>With the exception of Seton and Argyle, who seemed to
think the warden was receiving scant justice, and a weak
remonstrance from Lord James, which yielded gracefully to
the urgency of the case, the council agreed upon this precautionary
measure, and it was carried accordingly.</p>

<p>Secretary Maitland made out the warrant for the earl’s
committal; it wanted but the Queen’s signature to become
valid.</p>

<p>Mary rose from her chair and drew up her majestic figure.</p>

<p>‘Nay, my lords,’ said she;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> ‘it is surely unjust to condemn
the absent without proof. Let the warden return to
his charge on the border. He may render himself at any
time, in less than twenty-four hours from Hermitage.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot refuse to ratify the deed of your council!’
urged Ruthven, fiercely. ‘Nay, Madam, you <em>dare</em> not,’ he
added, with growing insolence; and would have said more;
but Mary shot a glance at him, before which even his rugged
nature quailed.</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty’s confidence in the earl is greater than that
of your advisers,’ observed Morton, not deigning to conceal a
sneer. ‘Already he boasts of his influence over the Queen,
and vows that steel gauntlet shall not wrest him from Holyrood,
though a white glove can lure him from Hermitage.’</p>

<p>The colour rose on Mary’s brow, and her bosom heaved
quickly. It was evident the Queen was wavering.</p>

<p>‘It is but a measure of precaution,’ argued Maitland, in his
plausible off-hand tones, spreading at the same time the
warrant before his sovereign. ‘After all,’ he added, ‘it may
be but a mere brawl about a wench! The Earl of Bothwell
has ever been given to such follies overmuch.’</p>

<p>The Queen signed the paper hastily; then threw the pen
on the table, and walked in silence from the council-chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Oh! better for me that a blind-born child</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Never a line I had learn’d to trace,</div>
<div class="verse">Than thus by a look and a laugh beguiled,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So Bothwell was committed to ward in Edinburgh Castle, yet
was his durance but of a temporary nature, and devoid of
the customary rigours that accompany imprisonment. The
warden made no effort to escape, although he had a strong
party of friends about the Court, and might at any time have
created considerable disturbance had he chosen to resist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
royal authority; but he bowed his head to the blast with
unexpected humility, and a submission, the result of mixed
motives. He lived in daily expectation of release by the
Queen’s own authority. His appointment on the border had
not yet been filled up, and Hermitage was still occupied by
a staunch garrison who acknowledged no law but their chief’s
behests. Day by day did the warlike earl, pining, as well he
might, for the free breeze on his brow and the swinging gallop
of his steed, reflect on the effect which such devotion as his
could not fail to produce on the Queen. Danger he had
always faced readily for her sake; fatigue he had cheerfully
endured; and now he submitted patiently to captivity,
because it was Mary Stuart’s will. Day by day he expected
a pardon, a release, an acknowledgment, a communication,
and day by day he was disappointed. ‘Hope deferred maketh
the heart sick;’ but this proverb applies rather to weak
natures; in strong, it is apt to make the heart savage. Stung
by what he conceived to be ingratitude, irritated by neglect,
sore from conflicting feelings, such as rend an ill-disciplined
character with pangs to which mere physical suffering is
comparative relief, those weeks spent in Edinburgh Castle
produced an effect on Bothwell’s disposition that after years
could never eradicate. Even ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ who remained
in attendance on his master, and who was free to
come and go at his pleasure, shook his head gravely, and
averred that ‘confinement was just destruction baith to man
an’ beast! He would like fine to see the warden ridin’ the
Marches again wi’ the Liddesdale lads at his back.’</p>

<p>But though Dick thus expressed himself, and doubtless
meant what he said, he was conscious in his heart that the
banks of the Esk and the braes of Teviotdale would never
be the same to him again. The brawny borderer had a new
interest in life now, strange to say, unconnected with hawk
or hound, with morning chase or midnight foray, with axe or
lance, or mighty stoups of ale.</p>

<p>Once in the week it was Mary Seton’s custom to visit the
town of Edinburgh on foot, to make purchases for her mistress
and her comrades, of those odds and ends which ladies consume
in such wonderful quantities. The wilful little damsel
had taken a great fancy to the borderer, as you may see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
child sometimes pleased with a huge Newfoundland dog.
Such attachments are not remarkable for reciprocity. The
biped, half-pitiful, half-amused, entertains a feeble liking for
so faithful an attendant; the quadruped wishes no better lot
than to serve its little idol slavishly all its life, and die licking
its hand. How the child cuffs it and teases it, and makes the
noble animal ridiculous, pulling its ears and tail!</p>

<p>‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ had but one day now in his week
instead of seven. He observed, not without inward gratulation,
that his attendance on these saints’ days, so to speak,
was by no means unwelcome; and Mary Seton, on her return
to the palace, never omitted to inform the Queen that she
had seen Earl Bothwell’s henchman, neither did her mistress
take her to task herself, nor suffer Mary Beton to do so, for
these interviews.</p>

<p>So the strangely matched pair moved along the High
Street, and the lady, who, in addition to his other good
qualities, had discovered the borderer to be a capital listener,
told him the Court news, for the edification of his chief, with
considerable volubility.</p>

<p>‘We’re all in confusion now,’ said she, one bright winter’s
day, as she tripped along the cleaner portion of the pavement
with a light basket in her hand, which sometimes as a great
favour she permitted her Newfoundland to carry, while that
faithful animal stamped contentedly alongside in the gutter.
‘The palace is turned inside out. We have got the “new
acquaintance” at Holyrood.’</p>

<p>Dick looked as if he didn’t understand, and yet did not
quite like the information. Something that would have been
jealousy in a more presumptuous admirer, shot through his
great frame. Had he been physically a retriever, he would
have put his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>‘I dinna like acquaintances,’ said he, looking <em>down</em> at her
bodily a foot or so; looking <em>up</em> at her metaphorically any
number of yards. ‘Give me friends, Mistress Seton, auld
friends, an’ no too mony o’ them.’</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t like this acquaintance!’ laughed the young
lady, merrily, whereat her companion looked on her admiringly,
as one who listens to sweet music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> ‘He’s an acquaintance
that would put <em>you</em> on your back readily, for as strong as you
think yourself; he has overcome the Queen and the household
and Mr Randolph and Mary Beton, and all of them
but <em>me</em>.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ replied the borderer. He did not the least understand
what she meant, but admired her intensely, nevertheless.</p>

<p>‘It’s the sickness,’<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at last she condescended to explain,
between bursts of laughter at her companion’s puzzled countenance.
‘There are but two of the Queen’s ladies fit for
duty at all&mdash;Mary Carmichael and me; and she is so occupied
with your chief’s kinsman, Mr Maxwell, that she couldn’t be
more useless if she was ill in bed. The Court is as dull as
ditch-water, and I shall have to walk up this weary hill to do
everybody’s business twice a week instead of once; that is the
upshot of it.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> An epidemic that prevailed at the Court, answering to the indisposition
which we now term <i>influenza</i>, and mentioned by Randolph in
his letters to Cecil.</p>

</div>

<p>A ray of intense pleasure gleamed on her listener’s face at
this announcement; but it clouded over a minute afterwards,
and he asked with undisguised anxiety, ‘If there was no
danger for herself?’</p>

<p>The girl could not but feel gratified at his obvious interest
in her safety; but she laughed again, and answered, merrily&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Do you think nobody can be bold who is not six foot
high? I fear sickness, I tell you, as little as you fear Lord
Scrope, and hate it perhaps more; and yet you have the best
of it, too. I had rather face death on an open moor than in
closed bed-curtains. I wonder if anybody would miss me
much?’ she added, more to herself than him, for the grave
chord had somehow been struck in her thoughtless character.</p>

<p>He did not answer, and when she looked at him, his face
was turned away.</p>

<p>‘Do you think they would?’ she proceeded, with the pertinacity
of a spoiled child. ‘Stranger things have come to
pass. You might be riding merrily in Liddesdale, whilst Mary
Seton was lying stark and cold under the Abbey stones.’</p>

<p>‘It would be a dark day in Liddesdale,’ was all the answer
he made; but he would not let her see his face, and his voice
sounded as it had never done before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>A tinge of remorse, such as that which the urchin feels
when he takes a bird’s-nest, smote almost unconsciously at the
girl’s heart; yet was the sensation, though pathetic, by no
means unpleasant.</p>

<p>She laughed and bantered him more than usual during their
walk; but on that day, and indeed every day afterwards till
he returned to the border, she suffered him to carry her
basket; and the honest retriever, proud of his degradation,
followed at her heel, with ever-increasing fidelity and devotion.
The bird’s-nest was taken now, and it is no use attempting
to put such articles back again; moreover, it had been
thoroughly harried, emptied clean of its treasures, and all the
eggs were in that one basket.</p>

</div>

<p>Unusual silence prevailed in the lofty hall of Hermitage,
and the dinner hour, commonly one of mirth and festivity,
arrived with a solemn gravity, by no means welcome to the
light-hearted borderers. It was in vain that large joints of
beef and mutton steamed on the long tables, and ample
baskets, piled to the edge with coarse oaten bread, stood side
by side with deep measures of foaming ale below the salt,
while a modest display of plate, in which one or two church
ornaments were conspicuous, decked the upper end of the
board. The preparations, indeed, smacked of good cheer, but
the hilarity which promotes digestion was wanting.</p>

<p>The master-spirit, gloomy, morose, and preoccupied, walked
to and fro under the stag’s antlers, at the extremity of the
hall, and no man dared to question or interrupt his meditations.</p>

<p>Bothwell was indeed chafing to the verge of madness. In
vain he had submitted patiently to a mock imprisonment at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Queen’s pleasure; in vain he had waited till days grew to
weeks and weeks to months for some acknowledgment from
Mary of the injustice she had done him&mdash;some expression of
sorrow or sympathy for the loyal soldier and devoted vassal.
No acquittal came, no reprieve, no message. Desperate and
goaded he had escaped from his confinement at last, and fled
to Hermitage, where he now found himself, as autumn waned,
in the anomalous attitude of an attainted subject holding
a royal fortress, and a warden of the Marches, without the
privilege of communicating with his sovereign. It has been
truly said that no position is so false as that which entails
responsibility without conferring authority, and of this he
found himself too keenly conscious. Neither was Bothwell’s
a nature to submit patiently to a slight. Hot-headed and
irascible, with strong feelings and a sad want of foresight, he
could act, but he could not endure. At this period he had
indeed sufficient reason to feel aggrieved, and he fretted like
some wild animal in a cage. It was noon; the guard was
being relieved in the outer court. Bustle reigned in the
kitchen; two or three old hounds, with wistful faces, licked
their lips as they nosed the savoury preparations that emanated
from that department; hawks screamed and flapped
their wings on the perch; everything denoted the arrival of
the most important hour in the twenty-four.</p>

<p>By twos and threes brawny men-at-arms lounged into the
hall and took their places at the board. A year ago, shout
and jest and schoolboy prank would have been rife at such a
moment; the earl’s laugh would have been the loudest and
his voice the gayest amongst them all; now they watched him
pacing silently to and fro, with looks askance. Taking their
cue from their chief, the boisterous riders were gloomy as
mutes.</p>

<p>Bothwell turned suddenly and summoned his henchman.</p>

<p>‘Is the holy man not ready yet?’ said he, with something
of irony in his tone. ‘Ho! bid the knaves bring in the food.
Cowl or cassock, rochet and stole, or black Geneva gown, not
one of them but comes to corn as kindly as the longest-legged
borderer that ever lifted a spear. Bid them serve, Dick, in
the devil’s name.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, James Hepburn,’ said a deep, stern voice at the ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>l’s
elbow, ‘not in the name of the evil one, but in His from
whom cometh all good. Bless the food,’ he added, stretching
both hands over the board which was now spread, and
shutting his eyes reverently while he prayed: ‘Bless those
good things which are the product of thrift and honest industry,
and may every morsel turn to gall on the lip, and poison
in the breast, that is wrested by violence and bloodshed from
the store of the widow and the fatherless!’</p>

<p>‘Amen!’ ejaculated Bothwell, without pretending to conceal
the sneer on his lip, as he took his seat; whilst his
retainers, glancing with a comical mixture of respect and
astonishment at a man who dared to address their formidable
chief in accents of reproach, seemed uncertain how to receive
a blessing of such doubtful import on the border. The obvious
course was to fall to without further ceremony; and soon
the clatter of knives and drinking-horns drowned all qualms
of conscience, if indeed such were experienced; ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
merely remarking, as he filled his trencher, ‘that if
all the beef in the larder that was <em>lifted</em> behoved to turn to
gall, there wou’d be no want o’ mustard for a whiley in Liddesdale.’</p>

<p>Evidently putting a strong constraint on himself, the earl
proceeded to entertain his guest with marked distinction and
courtesy. Indeed, after a time, the stately bearing and obvious
sincerity of the man could not fail to produce a favourable
effect; and though Bothwell, for political reasons, was disposed
to court his good opinion, he could not but confess to
himself, that under that black robe and grave exterior, lurked
a spirit equal in point of courage, and far superior in energy,
perseverance, and force of character, to his own.</p>

<p>Even the rude borderers felt the influence of his presence.
Although the name of John Knox was ere this familiar in all
men’s mouths, through the length and breadth of Scotland,
these lawless soldiers, while professing, for the most part, the
Reformed religion, which combined in their eyes the intrinsic
advantages of freedom, liberality, and cheapness, were at heart
wofully indifferent to its tenets, or its obligations. They had
thrown off with small compunction the shackles of the Roman
Catholic Church; they were not quite so ready, however, to
submit themselves to the discipline of that faith which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
supplanted it. In all violent and fundamental changes of
opinion, the teachers of a new doctrine have to contend with
two serious difficulties: the ill-judged warmth of their more
zealous disciples, and the convenient indifference of a large
proportion of converts, who cannot be brought to see the advantage
of dissent, if it is to substitute one form of government
for another.</p>

<p>Physically, the great Scottish Reformer appeared scarcely
equal to the work he had engaged to perform. His spare
frame was indeed sufficiently ascetic to command respect; and
his dignified bearing, well set off by the close black gown,
with its loose sleeves, which he chose to wear, was not unworthy
of the holy profession of which he was so zealous a
member; but his stature was low, and his bodily strength
proportionate. Nevertheless in his high grave brow, only partially
covered by a close black skull cap, there was rectitude,
pitiless, indeed, of others’ weakness, but equally stern and
uncompromising towards its own. The bold features and pale
colouring of the face, more remarkable than comely, denoted
energy with force of will; and though the mouth was somewhat
large and coarse, its expression was firm and daring in
the highest degree. His dark eyes, which it was his habit to
fix intently on those with whom he conversed, were brilliantly
piercing, and in the heat of argument or declamation shone
and sparkled with an inward flame. A flowing beard descended
to his girdle, somewhat softening the harshness of his
features, and imparting a patriarchal dignity to his whole
person. There was but little appearance of versatility on his
immovable face, and yet John Knox, driven by his zeal into
the political stream, had been forced to trim his bark more
than once to suit the exigencies of the storm; and it may be
that this very consciousness added to the stern defiance of his
bearing.</p>

<p>Without attempting to be ‘all things to all men,’ the
Reformer never forgot for an instant the one end and aim of
his unceasing efforts, the destruction of papacy in his native
land; and if ever he did turn aside for an advantage, or
halt for a breathing-space, it was but to gather fresh energies
for the great work, and devote himself more unreservedly to
its accomplishment. If he was prejudiced, bigoted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
illiberal, he was at least an honest man thoroughly in
earnest.</p>

<p>The latter quality invariably wins respect in the rudest, as
in the most civilised societies, and even Earl Bothwell’s wild
jackmen could not withhold an involuntary homage from one
whose peaceful profession, while it did not affect his insensibility
to physical danger, or his coolness under trying
circumstances, was followed out with an energy and perseverance
of which their own lawless pursuits afforded no
example. The Reformer, too, for all his infirmities, could
back a horse and fly a hawk with the best of them. His
stirring life had given him habits of activity and daring,
whilst the energy of action was not wanting, which is so
useful an accessory to a keen intellect. Though he ate
sparingly, the preacher’s cup was filled and emptied with
grave, good fellowship, and he did not disdain to mingle in
such mirth as was restrained within the bounds of decorum.
There was a spice of quaint humour in his conversation that
insensibly excited the attention of the most careless listeners;
and though he never so far forgot his sacred office as to
descend into buffoonery, he was no contemner of a ludicrous
illustration or a harmless jest.</p>

<p>The dinner, nevertheless, progressed wearily. The churchman’s
presence restrained that wild ribaldry which had been,
of late, Bothwell’s only attempt at gaiety; and when the jackmen
had eaten their fill, and satisfied their thirst, a gloomy
silence once more pervaded the old hall.</p>

<p>It was the practice at Hermitage to conclude every meal
with the standing toast of ‘Snaffle, spur, and spear;’ but
to-day cups were emptied less cordially than usual to the
accustomed pledge, and a long grace from Mr Knox immediately
succeeding, it was received by the listeners with
more respect than attention. It was a relief to all when the
earl, calling for a basin and ewer, dipped his hands, wiped
his beard, and rose from table, summoning the Reformer to
attend him for a stroll upon the rampart, and whispering a
few words to ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ as he passed out of the
hall.</p>

<p>That worthy received his master’s commands with an
appearance of intense gratification, which communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
itself, as if by electricity, to the majority of his comrades.
Bustle and activity seemed all at once to pervade the castle,
and the merriment hitherto stifled and repressed broke forth
with renewed violence. The tramp of horses and the clank
of steel smote gratefully on ears in which such sounds made
the sweetest of music; and when the churchman crossed the
courtyard in search of his host, he found it filled by some
two score of well-mounted men-at-arms, drawn up in disciplined
army, with ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ at their head.</p>

<p>The earl was giving his final orders to this leader with
considerable energy. He was in a towering passion, none
the less unbridled that he was not going to command the
expedition himself.</p>

<p>‘Were he ten times warden,’ the Reformer heard him say,
‘he should not drive horses, with impunity, from my side
the March. Does my Lord Scrope think that James Hepburn
has been superseded at Hermitage? or that I am a
likely man to submit to the slight he has endeavoured to
put upon me? Faith, not while this arm of mine can lay
lance in the rest. If you come across the English warden,
Dick Rutherford, you shall cast James Hepburn’s defiance in
his teeth. Within twenty-one days, alone, or with his
following, on foot or on horseback, with spear, sword, or axe,
and not more than three English miles from the border, I challenge
him to meet me, if he be a man, and “God defend the
right!” Have you picked the horses?’ he added, abruptly,
and turning with a soldier’s eye to scan the troop.</p>

<p>‘I cast the twa four-year-aulds,’ answered Dick, ‘an’ I
waled the soar<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the three bays, forbye the white-footed
yane, an’ I’m ridin’ Wanton Willie mysel’. Gin I track the
drove to Peel-fell, will I follow them into Cumberland?’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Sorrel or chestnut&mdash;next to bay, the favourite colour of the
borderers.</p>

</div>

<p>‘Follow them to hell!’ answered Bothwell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> ‘I will
have that gray gelding back if he is stabled in Carlisle. I’ll
have him from under Lord Scrope himself, if the Englishman
never gets across a horse again. What! there is peace between
the two countries, more’s the pity, or I had been at his
castle-gate by this time with all Teviotdale at my back; and
so you may tell him, if you can meet with him under steel.’</p>

<p>‘They might ha’ been ta’en by the Langholme lads,’
interposed Dick, whose spirits were rising considerably with
the prospect of a foray, but who looked upon the whole
affair, nevertheless, as a matter of business combined with
wholesome recreation. ‘They lifted a score o’ runts frae
“daft Davie,” in Lammas time, an’ took the vara’ coverlet
aff his wife’s bed. He saw it himsel’ at Dumfries, puir
fallow!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay,’ answered Bothwell, ‘the Langholme riders do
not come down by the score, with dags, and petronels, and
St George’s cross on their basnets. If it’s not a warden-raid,
as, indeed, it can hardly be, it has been done by the
warden’s orders; and he shall answer it to me as sure as I
serve Queen Mary! At least, with all her pride, she shall
know that Bothwell never suffered it to be lowered an inch,’
he muttered between his teeth as he turned away.</p>

<p>‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ put the men in motion and himself
at their head. As they emerged upon the open ground from
the gray walls of the square old keep, the slanting beams of
an autumn sun gilded the brown heather, and shed a soft
lustre over the undulating moorland ere it flashed from the
steel armour of the troop. The riders were in high spirits
at the prospect of a change from their long period of inaction.
The horses snorted and shook their bridles gaily. It was a
party of pleasure and adventurous excitement to all concerned,
and even now they were anticipating their plunder and
jesting about their profits. Only one heart felt more softened
than usual under its steel breastplate. ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
acknowledged the influence of the mellow sunlight and the
balmy breeze. Somehow the very earth and sky seemed to
connect themselves with a pair of laughing eyes and a
shower of bright hair, with a fairy figure tripping up the
High Street, a basket on its arm; or, as he had seen it first,
shining like a vision of light in the dark passages of Holyrood,
with a voice that used to thrill so sweetly once,
that he never heard now but in his dreams. The henchman
would have fought like a lion, and yet he felt tenderly disposed
towards all living things. He would have met death
more cheerfully than ever, yet he seemed only to have
learned the value of life within the last few months; another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
contradiction&mdash;but is it not full of contradictions, that engrossing
folly in which the true believer is as sure to suffer
martyrdom as the false worshipper is to obtain his reward?</p>

<p>The earl and his visitor watched the troop defiling round
the base of a low acclivity that soon hid them from sight.
As they disappeared, Bothwell turned away with a bitter
curse. He scarcely felt as if he had a right to order an
expedition on the border in the name of his sovereign; and
again Mary’s injustice and neglect rankled like a poisoned
shaft in his breast. But the earl was in no mood for
balancing probabilities or counting cost. The horses that
had been driven were his own, and he had reason to believe
that Lord Scrope was not ignorant of the theft. This was
sufficient to rouse his ire to the utmost, and he had despatched
a force to follow and retake them, strong enough to
preclude the possibility of failure. It was maddening,
though, to be compelled to stay within the four walls of
Hermitage, when his retainers were in the field; maddening,
all the more that his present false position, as he argued,
was owing to a queen’s injustice and a woman’s ingratitude.</p>

<p>A few short turns upon the rampart, with the soft west
wind fanning his brow, restored his composure, and addressing
his companion, he professed his readiness to enter at
once upon the business which had brought the latter to Hermitage.</p>

<p>The preacher pointed to the surrounding scenery, the
waving tracts of moorland bathed in the lustre of an afternoon
sun, the cattle feeding securely in the green nooks and
pasturage which broke the uniformity of the undulating
waste, the yellow patch of cultivation under the very
shadow of the keep, and the clear, autumnal heaven above all,
pale and serene, and dappled here and there by flaky clouds
edged with gold.</p>

<p>‘It is not <em>my</em> business,’ said the preacher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> ‘nor is it <em>thine</em>,
Lord Warden, that hath brought me here, but the will of
Him who holdeth this glorious universe in the hollow of His
hand. It is to do His work that I have ridden through these
wastes from dawn till mid-day, and that I must depart again
ere set of sun. I charge thee to aid me, heart and hand, in
the service of my Master!’</p>

<p>It is the misfortune of earnest men that, in this self-seeking
world of ours, they seldom obtain the credit they
deserve for sincerity and singleness of heart. Bothwell listened
with outward respect, yet unworthy suspicions <em>would</em>
not be kept down.</p>

<p>‘Now for some double-dyed intrigue,’ was his inmost
thought, ‘some plot set on foot by impenetrable Moray, not
satisfied with his new earldom, and turbulent Morton, with
his own craft added to the recklessness of all his Douglas
ancestors, and Maitland, the skilful penman, the subtle
diplomatist, wise as the serpent and plausible as the father
of lies himself. They would fain make a cat’s-paw of rude
James Hepburn, for, doubtless, they want a bold heart and a
ready hand to aid their schemes, and they send this godly
man, half-fanatic, half-hypocrite, to feel if the tool be heated
the right temper. I wot they may burn their fingers, one
and all of them, yet!’ But he only answered, abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I believe you are the friend of my house. You will counsel
nothing that can prejudice my honour, or my loyalty to
the Queen.’</p>

<p>‘My great-grandfather, my gude-sire, and my father, have
served your family, James Hepburn, for three generations.
Ay! served them when their banner was waving in the
fore-front of the battle, and the arrows of the English archers
were hailing against their harness like a storm from hell.
Do you think their blood is not boiling in my veins because
I wear a Geneva cassock for a steel breastplate? Do you
think if my forebears shrank not to ride through fire and
water for the Hepburn, I would fear to encounter death in
his defence, much less would tempt him to danger or disgrace?
Nay, my lord earl, though the commands of <em>my</em>
Master are imperative, they will but lead to your aggrandisement
in this world, and your salvation in the next.’</p>

<p>John Knox paused and turned a scrutinising look on his
companion’s face.</p>

<p>The latter plucked a morsel of grass from the rampart,
and flung it on the breeze.</p>

<p>‘Let us see how the wind blows,’ he replied, with a scornful
laugh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> ‘fair or foul, ye can trim your sails to it, all of
ye, and I can ride through a storm with the best!’</p>

<p>‘Nay!’ exclaimed the Reformer; ‘the labourer is worthy
of his hire; know ye not that the great trial is approaching
between the powers of darkness and the children of light?
In France, the sovereign and his ministers are determined to
stifle the good cause with the strong hand, and even now the
blood of saints and martyrs crieth aloud from the very stones
in the streets of Paris. The scarlet woman who spreadeth
her mantle over the Seven Hills, and waveth her white arms
abroad to lure souls to perdition, seducing some with indulgences
and driving others to despair with her curse, is
battling for her very existence, and that of the reptiles she
hath spawned, and who crawl around her feet. Here in
Scotland&mdash;ay, at Holyrood itself&mdash;hath not an image been
erected unto Baal? and is not the idolatry of the mass raised
weekly by Mary Stuart, whom men call Queen of Scotland,
and who is herself a daughter of perdition?’</p>

<p>‘Hold!’ exclaimed Bothwell, in a voice of thunder, and
advancing a step towards the speaker, as though about to
hurl him from the rampart. He restrained himself, however,
with an obvious effort, and proceeded in a calmer voice, ‘It
was not to malign his Queen that you sought an interview
with the most devoted of her servants?’</p>

<p>Knox saw his zeal had carried him too far. The Reformer,
like those whose persuasion he reprobated, was somewhat
prone to allow that ‘the end justified the means.’ He
retraced his steps, therefore, as it were, and resumed more
calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Her Majesty must be saved from the influence of evil
advisers. Why are her communications with the bloody
Guises so frequent? Why is Popish Riccio all-powerful at
Holyrood? Why is Bothwell virtually banished, and well
nigh attainted for a traitor? But because there is a schism
in the camp of the faithful, and a house divided against itself
shall not stand.’</p>

<p>‘The Queen has, indeed, dealt me scant justice,’ answered
the earl, musingly. ‘What would your employers have
me do?’</p>

<p>‘I speak for myself,’ replied the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> ‘or rather I speak
the words that are borne in unto me by Him whose servant
I am. What shall ye say of a family in which brother is at
variance with brother? of an army in which troop falls away
from troop, for some petty feud, when the enemy is drawn up
over against them in battle array? The nobles of Scotland
are gathering to the front for the defence of their souls’
liberties, and the boldest spirit amongst them all keeps aloof
here at Hermitage because of a foolish brawl with a weak
enthusiast who bore him no real ill-will.’</p>

<p>‘I will never return to Holyrood,’ answered Bothwell, looking
wistfully towards the north while he spoke, ‘till the Queen
sends for me herself and acknowledges her injustice. I will
never stretch the hand of reconciliation to Arran till I have
dealt him a buffet with a steel gauntlet and a Jedwood axe
in its grasp.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay,’ expostulated the Reformer; ‘shall the edifice
that such as you might rear on the goodly foundation of religious
zeal, with the barons of Scotland for your fellow-workmen,
crumble away for want of one stone in its right place?
Once reconciled with Arran, the house of Hamilton might
easily be secured in your interest. I can take upon myself
to promise so much, or why am I here to-day? With
Moray’s good-will, Morton’s friendship, the duke’s aid, and
the favour of the godly throughout the kingdom, who so
powerful at court as the Earl of Bothwell? Would it not
be well to teach the Queen (for her own welfare) the indispensable
lesson that a woman can only rule through the
influence of men&mdash;by the brain of the wise and the arm of
the strong? Would it not be well that Mary Stuart should
learn, once for all, that she must look to James Hepburn as
her champion and her trust?’</p>

<p>The picture was painted in glowing colours, and set in a
vivid light. The temptation to such a nature as Bothwell’s
was indeed of the strongest. It thrilled through heart and
brain, that imaginary victory which should place in his power
the option of humbling her to the dust, by whom he felt so
aggrieved, or, better still, of foregoing his revenge and enjoying
the nobler yet more complete triumph of forgiveness to
his Queen. Nevertheless, the feudal feeling of resentment
for an aspersion was still strong within him.</p>

<p>‘But he accused me of treason,’ urged the earl, lashing
himself once more into anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> ‘would have attainted me
before the council as a traitor to Queen Mary, as a rebel
who meditated violence on her sacred person!’</p>

<p>‘The dream of a madman!’ answered Knox. ‘You know
well that the earl’s health has long been failing, that he is of
those who are scourged and tormented in the body for the
discipline of their souls. In his paroxysms of insanity he is
as one possessed, but they leave him like the poor maniac
from whom devils were cast out, “clothed and in his right
mind.” Nay, he did but accuse you of that which he had
himself meditated in his madness. The Earl of Arran did
indeed entertain a wild project to carry off the person of
Mary Stuart, and immure her in some stronghold at his
pleasure. The scheme was that of a madman, and yet might
it have been feasible, nevertheless.’</p>

<p>Bothwell started, and turned pale. He could not trust
himself to speak. At that moment, wild phantom shapes,
that had vaguely haunted him for long, seemed suddenly to
assume a distinct aspect of reality. Dropped by an unconscious
hand, the seed now struck root, that was hereafter
destined to bear such appalling fruit. The offspring of a
chance word, a wild and maddening vision took possession of
his brain. He looked around at the solid dimensions of his
fortress; he counted the gallant hearts within its walls, for
whom his will was law; he thought of his friends and following,
his resources and his influence, his own daring and
his father’s brilliant crimes. One desperate cast for the
great stake; one bold swoop for the shrinking quarry; a few
shots, a thrust or two, a white form borne swiftly away at a
gallop, and the sweet face that had been a dream to him all
his life might become a reality at last!</p>

<p>Why, even crazed Arran had been man enough to entertain
such a scheme, whilst he, Bothwell, was eating his own heart
here at Hermitage. Well, stranger things had come to pass.
He must watch and bide his time; must be wary, vigilant;
above all, must be patient. It was a stirring season. For a
bold man <em>nothing</em> was impossible.</p>

<p>He replied at last, but cautiously and with reservations.
If he joined the Protestant party, agreeing to act with Moray,
Morton, and the rest, it must be under certain conditions; if
he consented to a reconciliation with Arran, it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
accompanied with sundry stipulations which should be communicated
hereafter at greater length. Even Maitland could
not have been more mysterious, and the Reformer found
himself wondering at the rapidity of a transformation which
had changed the wild, reckless, border noble into a cold and
scheming diplomatist.</p>

<p>He had attained his object, however, and that was enough
for him. With a firm persuasion that he was furthering the
good work, he took his leave of the earl, well-satisfied, resisting
all hospitable importunities to remain, and even declining
the offer of an escort to conduct him in safety through
that lawless district.</p>

<p>‘My Master will care for me,’ said the preacher, as he prepared
to leave the castle on horseback when the shades of
night were closing in. ‘He who has sent me on my mission
will provide for the safety of His servant!’ And so departed
unarmed and alone.</p>

<p>Well might Morton hereafter pronounce over this dauntless
nature its well-known epitaph, ‘There lies one that never
feared the face of man.’</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell was ere this domiciled at Holyrood.
Attached to the Queen’s household, and devoted
to her person, Mary esteemed him not the least trustworthy
of those servants in whom she placed implicit confidence.
He had accompanied his sovereign on those roving
expeditions in which she took so much pleasure, when the
beautiful Stuart, worthy to reign over a nation of warriors,
would pass entire days in the saddle, traversing her dominions,
and making acquaintance with her subjects; or flying her
hawk and following her deer-hounds over the wild moorlands,
and amongst the romantic passes of her new kingdom. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had attended her in her progress to Aberdeen, that ill-advised
journey which, commencing with merriment and festivity, the
huntsman’s holloa and the cheering notes of the horn, ended
in strife and bloodshed and the wild wailing of the coronach,
cried by the widows of the Gordon over the flower of their
clan.</p>

<p>Maxwell had done good service on that sad day when the
waters of Corrichie ran crimson with the Highlandman’s
blood, and had turned with a brave man’s pity from the
sickening sight of Sir John Gordon’s execution at Aberdeen,
performed before the very eyes of the weeping Queen.
Gallant, handsome John Gordon! the victim of a political
intrigue, who walked to the block with the jaunty step of a
bridegroom in holiday attire, and waved his dying homage
to his sovereign, a brave soldier and a loyal gentleman to
the last.</p>

<p>It is said that Mary fainted at the sight; and, indeed, she
never attained the necessary hardness of heart to rule such a
turbulent and distracted country as that in which it was her
lot to reign.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion Maxwell had proved himself
the possessor of a shrewd brain, a silent tongue, and a ready
hand. His was that least courtier-like of characters, which
yet perhaps thrives best at a court. When all around are
selfish and intriguing, each feels well-disposed towards the
frank, single-hearted comrade who wishes but to serve his
sovereign loyally, and entertains cordial good-will towards
his fellows. Monarchs, too, even the haughtiest and most
exacting, are disposed to appreciate a blunt honesty that does
not shrink from encountering the royal displeasure for the
royal advantage, and doubtless find it refreshing from its contrast
with the servility to which they are accustomed. It
must be like the change from the sickly air of a hothouse to
the fresh mountain breeze. Besides, it is so easy to forgive
even insolence in those who are wholly in their power; and
there is a delicate flattery after all to the lion’s forbearance,
in the man’s temerity, who puts his head in the lion’s mouth.</p>

<p>The Queen of Scotland, however, was one of those who,
while they attach to themselves irresistibly all who come
within their sphere, are, from their own feelings, disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
think kindly of their immediate retainers, and to reward
fidelity and affection as they deserve.</p>

<p>Maxwell found himself in high favour with Mary, and it is
not strange that he should have been devoted heart and soul
to her interests. He persuaded himself that he was loyal to
his sovereign for her own sake, and ignored with considerable
determination that Mistress Carmichael had any influence
whatever over his sentiments.</p>

<p>That young lady’s behaviour at this juncture was of a
nature to make an admirer sufficiently uncomfortable. We
remember to have heard that there <em>are</em> female dispositions
on which the exercise of the affections has an irritating
tendency, and to whom the dawning possibility of eventful
thraldom is as agitating as it is inviting. These wild-birds,
albeit they become when tamed the gentlest of domestic
fowls, are sadly prone at first to beat their breasts against the
cage, also to peck viciously at the caressing hand that would
smooth their ruffled plumes. Whether it be that they entertain
a feminine delight in any state of sentiment, argument,
or fact involving a contradiction, or whether they indemnify
themselves, whilst they can, for future docility, we profess
ourselves incompetent to state; but the axiom seems to be
sufficiently established, that the process of taming is often
uncomfortable and hazardous, the result not always to be
depended upon when complete.</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael, in addition to her other qualifications,
was a devoted Papist; Maxwell, it is needless to observe, a
staunch Reformer. Religious feeling ran high at Holyrood.
The Romish Church, a zealous advocate for proselytism at all
times, has ever been most intolerant when losing ground;
and perhaps no bigotry is so blind as a woman’s adherence to
a sinking faith.</p>

<p>Maxwell could not conscientiously look with approval on
Mistress Carmichael’s rigid attendance at mass in the Chapel
Royal. The maid-of-honour concealed neither her dislike nor
her contempt for those who had abandoned the religion of
their fathers, and the ritual of their sovereign. This alone
was a fruitful source of irritation and ill-feeling between the
lovers, if so they can be called; and when we add that the
gentleman was of a haughty and reserved disposition, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
soul of honesty and frankness, without the slightest experience
in the ways of woman, and the lady as wilful, unjust,
and self-tormenting as those reasonable beings usually become
when thoroughly in earnest, it is superfluous to dwell
upon the feelings likely to exist between such a pair, continually
brooding over imaginary wrongs, and never for a
moment out of each other’s minds.</p>

<p>One scene, amongst many, may afford a specimen of the
terms on which they stood.</p>

<p>Maxwell was proceeding to the royal apartments with certain
papers which had been submitted to Mr Randolph’s inspection
ere they were returned to the Queen for signature&mdash;so anxious
was Mary, at this period, to keep well with her cousin of
England. Elizabeth’s ambassador had taken rather a fancy,
in his own selfish, easy way, to his former travelling companion,
and though, of course, he would have sacrificed him
without scruple, he probably liked him none the less that he
could not fashion him into a tool.</p>

<p>As Maxwell traversed the long gallery, Mistress Carmichael
was proceeding in the same direction with a basket of winter
roses gathered in the Abbey garden, and could not forbear
blushing as deep as the reddest of them when she encountered
him. Of course she was angry with herself for doing so, and
naturally visited the fault on him, arguing, plausibly enough,
that if he had not been there it would not have happened;
therefore she turned her head steadfastly away and marched
on without speaking. Hurt and irritated, he drew aside to
let her pass, thus meeting her, as it were, half-way in her
desire to avoid recognition. So far nothing could be simpler.
If the lady did not wish to be delayed she had only to pass
on without further stoppage. She did so accordingly, but by
the merest accident, and the most provoking awkwardness,
tilted her basket and dropped half her flowers on the floor.
Of course he was compelled to assist her in picking them up;
for these two were the only occupants of the gallery; so he
knelt down and refilled the basket gravely without a word.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Mary Carmichael, with the slightest
possible tremor in her voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> ‘How deftly you have done it,
and how much beholden to you I am!&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;thank
you, Mr Maxwell.’</p>

<p>Here was an opportunity that would have been seized by
any other gallant about the court to ask, at least, for one of
the roses in reward; and perhaps even Maxwell, though
somewhat impatient of such follies, would have been less reserved
with any other of the Maries than the one who now
stood before him, still arranging her basket, and obviously in
no immediate hurry to go away. He waited, however, for
her to speak first. After a little hesitation, she pointed to
the papers he was carrying.</p>

<p>‘Shall I take them for you to the Queen?’ said she, and
her hand trembled as she extended it towards him.</p>

<p>He took the pretty hand in his own, and she did not withdraw
it.</p>

<p>‘Mistress Carmichael,’ said he, ‘I am a plain man, and I
hope an honest one. I have not so many friends that I can
afford to lose any for lack of courage to ask an explanation.
How have I offended you of late? Tell me as frankly as I
ask you, and I will take care not to transgress again.’</p>

<p>Her bosom heaved, and her colour went and came.</p>

<p>‘Offended?’ she replied; ‘and me? oh, no! What have
I done to make you think so?’</p>

<p>He was still very grave, and a shade paler than before, but
his countenance was immovable, and indeed stern. It was
a peculiarity of Walter Maxwell that, under strong excitement,
his exterior became unusually cold and composed.</p>

<p>‘I have thought so for long,’ he resumed. ‘Perhaps it has
distressed me more than you would think possible. I trust
I have done my duty as thoroughly as if you and I had been
friends; but I have felt that difficulties appeared greater, and
hardships less endurable than if our differences had not existed.
The breach has widened day by day; ere long, you and I will
have learned to hate each other.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no!’ she murmured, scarce above her breath, but
she kept her head bent down, and the tears were dropping
fast among the winter-roses in her basket.</p>

<p>He had never let go her hand; he folded it in both his
own, and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Mary Carmichael,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> ‘since the day we first met in
the forest of Chambord, I have wished to be worthy of you,
and you alone. I am no woman-worshipper, no smooth-tongued
silken gallant, and yet I think there are few things
I could not do to please you; nothing, save my honour, I
would not sacrifice for your sake.’</p>

<p>A gleam of intense pride and pleasure shone for an instant
in her eyes; the next, her face contracted as if with pain, and
she looked up scared and wild, through her tears.</p>

<p>‘You must not say so&mdash;you must not say so,’ she exclaimed,
drawing her hand away hurriedly, and with a frightened, half-distracted
air. ‘Let me go now&mdash;let me go; I hear the others
coming.’</p>

<p>‘Is that your answer?’ said he, very lowly and distinctly,
but with a pale face, and something in his voice that it was
better not to trifle with.</p>

<p>She looked here and there, like some graceful wild animal
caught in the toils. Footsteps were indeed approaching, and
half the flowers were again scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>‘You must not say so,’ she repeated; but for an instant
she placed her hand once more in his with a lightning glance
of unspeakable tenderness; ‘at least not yet!’ she added,
and sped hurriedly away.</p>

<p>When she was gone, Walter Maxwell stooped down, picked
up one of the roses, and hid it carefully within his doublet.
Then he proceeded to his business with a lighter heart and a
brighter face than he had carried since he came to Holyrood.</p>

<p>We will follow the young lady to the apartment in which
the Maries were accustomed to congregate when off duty, plying
their needles with industrious rapidity, and lightening their
labours, we may be sure, with the pleasures of conversation.</p>

<p>It was a pretty room, high up in one of the turrets of the
palace, overlooking the Abbey garden, and was full of the
little elegancies and comforts which women gather about
them, or which seem to grow up around, in the most unlikely
places, as a natural consequence of their presence. Quaint
tapestry adorned its walls, less hideous than are usually those
grotesque efforts of industry, and representing pastoral scenes
of love-making and simplicity, not devoid of browsing sheep,
limpid streams, and fat little cupids flying about in the air.
Scarfs, fans, gloves, and needlework were scattered over the
room; and Mary Hamilton’s rosary of fragrant wooden beads,
inlaid with gold, hung from the back of a carved oak chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of which the cushions were triumphs of embroidery wrought
by the maids-of-honour themselves. A portrait of the Queen,
in her well-known velvet head-dress and voluminous ruff,
smiled above the chimney-piece; and immediately under it was
placed an elaborate crystal timepiece, of French workmanship,
presented by her mistress to Mary Beton, and reverenced
equally as a token of the royal good-will and a marvel of
mechanical art. The last-named lady glanced at it with the
conscious pride of possession.</p>

<p>‘It will be dark in less than an hour,’ said she, folding
away the corner of a large square piece of embroidery on
which herself and two of her companions were engaged; ‘we
have done enough for one day, and these small stitches are
very trying to the eyes. I expect the Queen’s summons, too,
every minute, for one or other of us.’</p>

<p>‘She is writing letters in her cabinet,’ answered Mary Carmichael,
who had her own reasons for knowing how large a
packet had just gone in. ‘I could see her beautiful head
bending over her table as I came down the terrace steps in
the Abbey garden when I brought you in these roses.’</p>

<p>‘You haven’t half filled the basket after all!’ exclaimed
Mary Seton, who was busy arranging the flowers about the
room; ‘and like your sex, my dear, you have taken care to
gather plenty of thorns. If I wear a garland of them at the
masque to-morrow, as I intended, I shall be a veritable Scotch
thistle, not to be touched with impunity; a fitting partner
for that masterful border-thief, little Jock Elliot, who cocks
his bonnet and sings “Wha dare meddle wi’ me?”’</p>

<p>‘You have become half a borderer yourself, I think, ever
since Bothwell was banished the court,’ answered the other,
not quite relishing this allusion to the half-filled basket, of
which the spoils were scattered in the gallery.</p>

<p>‘Poor Bothwell!’ answered Mary Seton, with a sigh;
‘now that is what I call a <em>man</em>! When he walks through
the court in his armour, he looks like a tower amongst the
other lords. There is not a taller or a more stalwart figure
amongst all his riders, proper men though they be, except
perhaps that gigantic henchman of his.’ And again the damsel
sighed, and looked grave for an instant, though she was
laughing merrily again the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Is he not coming back soon?’ asked Mary Hamilton,
waking up from one of her fits of abstraction, and fixing her
large mournful black eyes on Mary Seton’s saucy blue ones.</p>

<p>‘Who? which?’ asked the latter, mischievously.</p>

<p>‘Why, D’Amville,’ answered Mary Hamilton, absently;
‘were you not talking of him? He has been more than a
year away.’</p>

<p>‘D’Amville!’ exclaimed the other, with her ringing laugh;
‘I hope not! At least if he brings that mad poet in his
train, to turn all our heads with rhymes and flattery. Nothing
interests you but what comes from France! No, we
were talking of Bothwell, stout Earl Bothwell, who is worth
a dozen of him. I am sure the Queen thinks so.’</p>

<p>Mary Beton looked up reprovingly, but in vain; the flippant
speaker was in her swing, and not to be disappointed
of her say.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure we’ve all been dull enough at court ever since
Bothwell got into disgrace. And after all, I don’t believe he
bared steel till the others drew on him first. I <em>know</em> the
Hamiltons outnumbered his people two to one; and nobody
disputes that Arran is quite mad now, or that the duke was
always an old goose. I think it very hard that Bothwell
should have been made the scapegoat, that I do! and I’ve
always said he hadn’t fair play from first to last.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ interposed Mary Beton, gravely; ‘the matter
was tried in Her Majesty’s own presence, before the council.’</p>

<p>‘The council were a parcel of intriguers!’ vociferated the
little partisan, now getting positively vehement. ‘The council
wanted to get rid of him, because he was the most loyal
amongst them all, and they made the skirmish an excuse.
Why, I’m sure Ruthven is ready enough with his dagger, and
my own dear father cleared the High Street from end to end
with his own good sword and half a dozen jackmen before I
was born, and the king swore he was quite right. I’ve heard
him say so a score of times. No, no! the council had their
own reasons; and I’ll never believe but that Englishman was
at the bottom of it, though he pretended to be the warden’s
friend!’</p>

<p>‘If you mean Mr Randolph,’ said Mary Beton, bridling
within her ruff in high disdain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> ‘you only expose your ignorance
of state affairs. What could he have to do with it? or
how could the turbulence of a wild border noble affect the
Queen of England’s confidential minister?’</p>

<p>‘Only that I am convinced his red-haired mistress is at the
bottom of all the mischief that goes on here,’ answered the
other, determined not to be put down. ‘I believe she hates
our dear beautiful angel of a Queen, partly because she’s her
cousin, and partly because she’s been married, and partly because
there is nobody like her in this world. I won’t abuse
Randolph, Mistress Beton, because he admires you hugely,
and that shows the man has good taste; but I may say what
I like of Elizabeth Tudor, who is no more <em>my</em> Queen than I
am <em>hers</em>.’</p>

<p>The elder damsel looked mollified, though she feebly deprecated
the implied compliment.</p>

<p>‘These are dangerous topics,’ said she, gathering her draperies
around her, and rising from her chair. ‘It is enough
for us to occupy ourselves with our own office, and I cannot
conceive why we have not yet heard Her Majesty’s summons.’</p>

<p>This lady was of a methodical disposition, and loved to
perform her regular duties at their stated times without interruption.</p>

<p>‘Those endless letters!’ exclaimed Mary Seton; ‘and all
about treaties and alliances, and the most uninteresting subjects.
I declare I wouldn’t change places with the Queen to
have her beauty and her throne. She is harassed and wearied
to death. Dear me! how I wish she would marry, and take
some stout-hearted lord to share her troubles and anxieties
with her once for all!’</p>

<p>‘I’m surprised at you!’ exclaimed Mary Beton, now completely
shocked. ‘It is most indiscreet to talk on such
matters, and scarce maidenly even to think of them. Is it
that you might follow her example?’ she added, in a tone of
severe reproof.</p>

<p>‘I am not sure but what I should,’ sighed the other, and
relapsed into silence, which, strange to say, was not broken
for the space of full five minutes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the last suggestion thrown out had awakened
matter for reflection in the minds of each of the four Maries.</p>

<p>At the expiration of that period, however, Mary Beton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
remarked that it was getting very dark; and Mary Seton at
the same moment proposed that James Geddes, the Queen’s
fool, should be summoned to make sport for them during the
hour of idleness preceding supper.</p>

<p>‘I will go for him,’ said Mary Carmichael, and, wrapping
a plaid round her head and shoulders, hurried out of the
room.</p>

<p>James Geddes, who filled the honourable and somewhat
lucrative office of royal fool or jester in the palace of Holyrood,
was one of those half-witted unfortunates of whom so
many may be met with even in the present day in Scotland,
and who occupy the intermediate space between sanity and
positive imbecility. They cannot be termed lunatics, for
they are usually harmless, and even amiable in disposition,
showing kindly feelings towards animals, infants, and such
helpless objects, and even school-children, if not tormented
by the urchins beyond all endurance. They are not idiots,
for, although their perceptions may be warped, they are in
vigorous possession of their faculties, and indulge, indeed, in
a shrewd caustic humour of their own with which few
rational beings can compete. Neither can they be called
actually in their right mind. Perhaps the Scottish peasant
best describes the mental state of such an one when he says,
in an explanatory tone, ‘Ou! he’s just a natural!’</p>

<p>James Geddes, accordingly, was ‘just a natural,’ and
earned his wages, consisting of meat, and fee, a parti-coloured
suit of clothes, and a cap and bells which he
could not be persuaded to wear, by furnishing unlimited
mirth to the royal household, and occasionally a jest that
diverted the grave lords in council, and reached the ears of
the gentle Queen herself.</p>

<p>Such was the wiseacre, in search of whom Mary Carmichael
sped down the winding stairs that led from the Maidens’
Tower into the devious passages of the palace. Obviously
the most likely place in which to find him would have been
the buttery, for it is a kind compensation of nature, that
weakness of brain should be accompanied by great power of
the digestive organs, and James Geddes could eat as much
at one meal as would last a philosopher for a week. The
maid-of-honour, nevertheless, passed that well-stored apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
without stopping, and proceeded with a light step and
a heaving bosom into the Abbey garden, over which the dew
was falling, and the shades of evening gathering fast.</p>

<p>Passing through the flower-beds she had despoiled in the
afternoon, and which doubtless failed not to call up tender
recollections, the young lady glided like a phantom into the
shade of an adjoining orchard, through the branches of which
an early star or two were already beginning to twinkle down.
Here she halted, and, removing the shawl from her head,
peered into the darkness, and listened attentively, though
for a few minutes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘The beating of her own heart</div>
<div class="verse">Was all the sound she heard.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, by one of those coincidences which do occasionally
happen in real life, especially where certain mysterious affinities
combine to produce improbable results, Walter Maxwell
was returning from Secretary Maitland’s office to his own
lodging at the same twilight hour, and although it involved
a considerable <i>détour</i>, had chosen to proceed through the
Abbey garden, and along the corner of the orchard, from
which in the daytime he could see the windows of the
Queen’s apartments and those of her ladies. Walter was no
romantic enthusiast, to derive intense pleasure from a mere
association of ideas, and yet he paused under the shadow of
an old apple-tree, and gazing on the dark mass of building
opposite, recalled, with an intoxicating thrill, his interview
with his mistress in the gallery. We have, most of us, experienced
certain moments in life when we are satisfied to
enjoy present bliss, without taking into account the insufficiency
of its cause, or the shortness of its duration. We
know we are happier than we have any right to be, and we
wilfully ignore the consciousness, and refrain from asking
ourselves the ‘reason why.’ Like pride, this state of self-gratulation
usually ‘goeth before a fall.’</p>

<p>Maxwell’s quick ear could not fail to detect the light footstep
of his ladye-love as she, too, entered the orchard, and he
recognised her, muffled as she was, and in the darkness, as
we recognise intuitively those whom we have trusted with our
happiness. He sprang forward to meet her. Undemonstrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and calm as was his character, he would have caught her to his
heart, and vowed never to part with her from that moment;
but ere he had made one step in advance, a tall cloaked figure,
which seemed to come out of the very stem of an adjoining
tree, anticipated his movements, and Maxwell, scarce believing
his eyes, saw the woman he loved caught in its arms, and
disappearing in the folds of that close and familiar embrace.</p>

<p>He had nerve, temper, and, above all, self-command.
Though the cold drops stood on his forehead, and a deadly
sickness crept about his heart, he had presence of mind to
reflect on what he ought to do. In a dozen seconds he had
argued the point, for and against, in his own mind, and had
come to the conclusion that he was justified in undeceiving
himself, at such a crisis, by the evidence of his senses. He
remained under the shadow of the old tree and listened, with
every organ painfully acute, and every nerve strung to its
utmost pitch.</p>

<p>‘My darling,’ said the stranger, smoothing back the hair
from the face, which looked fondly up into his own, ‘how
late you are this evening! I should have gone without
seeing you in five minutes more; but I knew you would
not fail me, if you could help it, at our trysting-place.’</p>

<p>‘You might be sure of that,’ she answered, clinging to him
with both hands clasped upon his shoulder. ‘Last week,
and the week before, I came to the moment. I cannot bear
to keep you waiting, or to think of you watching and hiding
here like a thief&mdash;you that I am so proud of, and so fond of;
you on whose arm I would like to hang before the Queen and
the whole court, and I dare not even mention your name,
except in my prayers. You are cold,’ she added, wrapping
his cloak across his throat and chest with sedulous affection,
‘cold and wet with dew already, and perhaps tired and
hungry too, and I may not bring you into the palace, and
warm you, and take care of you. Oh! what a life it is!’</p>

<p>He laughed cheerfully, though with caution.</p>

<p>‘Always the same,’ he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> ‘always unselfish and considerate,
and thinking of me! Why, you little witch, do you
never reflect on what a scolding you would get if you were
caught running about like this, in the gloaming, to meet a
cavalier under a tree? What would Mistress Beton say forsooth?
Strict Mistress Beton! She would vow not a dove
would be left in the dove-cote after a while, if such doings
were passed over. Do I look like a hawk to harry a bird’s-nest,
Mary? Am I such a terrible wild young gallant, my
pretty one?’</p>

<p>She put her white hand over his mouth. Maxwell saw it
in the starlight.</p>

<p>‘Do not speak so loud,’ she said. ‘I am sure you are as
incautious as a boy. Indeed, I wish you <em>would</em> harry the
nest, as you say, and carry me off with you, for I am tired of
never seeing you, except by stealth; and then it makes me so
anxious and so fretful not to know where you are, or when
we shall meet, for weeks and months together.’</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ he answered, gravely, ‘it is in the Queen’s
service and that of our religion. It must triumph at last, as
sure as those stars are shining above our heads. You and I
have vowed to devote our lives, if need be, to the good
cause. If worst should come to worst, we shall not be separated
for long. There are no partings up there, Mary.’</p>

<p>He pressed her tenderly to his side, and pointed to the
sky, in which star after star were now glimmering forth.</p>

<p>She drew her hand across her eyes, and kissed him fervently
once more.</p>

<p>‘I shall be missed,’ she said. ‘I must stay no longer. It
is <em>very</em> hard not to see you again for such a time! Well,
well, duty before all. And now, have you the packet from the
cardinal? What say the Guises to the last communication?’</p>

<p>‘They dare not even write,’ he answered. ‘Though I
acted my part well, and looked such a masterful beggar, that
even you, Mary, would have flung me an alms, they searched
me when I landed at the port of Leith, scrip, wallet, and all;
nay, they broke my staff across, lest it should be hollow, and
filled with papers&mdash;I would I might have done it myself over
the knave’s pate that could be so wary. No; the despatches
must travel by word of mouth; and that is a better trick than
even Randolph has learned yet, with all his cunning. Listen,
Mary. They trust you, my pretty one, because you belong to
me&mdash;this is for the Queen’s private ear alone.’</p>

<p>Maxwell was a man of honour. He would stay to hear no
more. It was enough that his dearest hopes had withered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a breath. That the edifice he had been building insensibly
for so long, decking it with all his fancies, and furnishing it,
so to speak, with the most precious gifts of his affections, and
the warmest feelings of the heart, had crumbled into dust at
a moment’s notice. He would not, for that, intrude upon
another’s secrets; and although the delay of a few moments
might have placed him in possession of matters that would
have insured his own aggrandizement, and enabled him to
take a fearful revenge on the two by whom he felt so cruelly
injured, yet he stole noiselessly away, placing his hands upon
his ears, that he might not, inadvertently, hear another word
of their communications.</p>

<p>Where is the man who can consistently shape his conduct
upon a train of reasoning independent of his feelings,
at least where those feelings are vitally concerned? It never
occurred to him that he had no right to listen at all. The
question was one of life and death to him, and he felt justified
in arriving by any means at a certainty. Such is human nature
in the best of us. Principle is principle, and honour is
honour, only so long as circumstances are not too overwhelming,
or necessity too urgent. Conscience is the only
guide who never yet lost his way.</p>

<p>We will not follow Walter Maxwell as he left the Abbey
garden for the solitude of his own chamber, never utterly
dreary and forlorn till to-night. He had a brave, stout heart,
that could strive against any odds, and scorned to flinch from
any amount of pain. Perhaps these suffer most in proportion
to their strength.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After taking a tender farewell of the cloaked stranger, more
touching and affectionate, if possible, than her greeting,
Mary Carmichael fled back to the palace like a lapwing. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was no time to lose in securing James Geddes, if she would
not have the length of her absence remarked, and she found
him, as she expected, drinking a warm posset in the buttery.
Like the rest of his class, the fool could at times be sufficiently
self-willed and captious, rating his own society at no
trifling value, more especially if he saw that it was sought
after; and it required no small amount of management to
wheedle him into merriment if not so disposed. On the
present occasion he refused point-blank to stir from the chimney
corner, and it was only by dint of much coaxing, and the
promised bribe of a box of French comfits, that Mary Carmichael
prevailed on him to accompany her, and bore him off
in triumph to the turret-chamber, there to make sport for the
Queen’s maids-of-honour.</p>

<p>His entrance was greeted by acclamations, which he received
with complete indifference. He brightened up, however,
when the comfits were produced, and sat down to
munch them with an expression of the most perfect satisfaction
and vacuity.</p>

<p>He was a stout, middle-sized man, with a long, heavy face,
a large mouth, and hanging under-jaw. When he lolled his
tongue out, and half-shut his meaningless gray eyes, he
looked a being devoid of the slightest spark of intellect; at
such times, nevertheless, he was most apt to produce those
simple witticisms which served to amuse the court.</p>

<p>Not a word was to be got from him till he had finished
the comfits. At length, the last and largest disappeared down
that capacious maw; then he yawned, stretched himself, and
condescended to observe&mdash;</p>

<p>‘He would have to bid the ladies farewell, as to-morrow
he should take his leave of Holyrood.’</p>

<p>‘What shall we do without you?’ exclaimed Mary Seton,
who took James Geddes under her special protection, and
vowed, in her pert way, that he was infinitely more sane than
half the Queen’s advisers. ‘We cannot let you go&mdash;you are
the only amusement we have!’</p>

<p>‘There’ll be no lack of fules the morn,’ answered James,
with a look of comical disgust;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> ‘’deed they may call it
Follyrood now, with gude cause. Have ye no heard tell of
the braw doings in the Queen’s Park? Troth, ye’ll be able
to wale your Joes the morn! Every lass her lad! And they
riding mother-naked every man o’ them. Na, na; they’re no
wanting fules at court i’ the noo, an’ I’ll just tak’ my foot in
my hand, an’ turn wise-like mysel’.’</p>

<p>‘Why, the masque will only be six against six as usual,’
answered Mary Beton, characteristically disposed to take a
matter-of-fact view of the proceedings, ‘six savages and six
amazons. I have seen the dresses; and very complete they
are. What is there in that to displease you, James? I
thought you dearly loved a festival or a frolic.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll no gang till I’ve had my denner,’ answered James;
‘but I’ll no bide at Holyrood, once the trade is overstocked,
as it is like to be. I’ll just gang my ways to the Border, an’
take up with stout Earl Bothwell and muckle Dick. He’ll
like fine to get word o’ Mistress Seton. Troth, if they measure
fules by the foot, ye’ve gotten a grand yane, my bonny
doo, to your share; for ye’ve clean bewitched Dick.’</p>

<p>That young lady laughed and blushed, then frowned and
looked cross, lastly peeped into the box of comfits for something
to stop James’s mouth withal. The latter put on his
densest look, and proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Ay, the time’s no what it was. I mind when me and
Jenny Colquhoun was the only fules in Holyrood; forbye the
French lassie, that was no worth speaking of, and Robin
Hamilton the porter. Set him up! to shut the wicket in
my very face last St Andrew’s day, and swear he would
break my sconce across, if it wasna as toom as a borderer’s
bonnet. Awbody kens he’s a Hamilton, an’ the Hamiltons
have aye mair hide than horns. Nae offence to the bonny
leddy here, that’s no mindin’ the like o’ me. Aweel, there’s
mair fules than three at Holyrood i’ the noo; an’ it’s time
for James Geddes to be packing, when he’s the only wise-like
body about the place.’</p>

<p>‘Then you think we are all losing our wits,’ remarked
Mary Carmichael, as she made up the wood-fire, lit the silver
lamp that stood on the table, and set the room in order,
according to her wont.</p>

<p>‘Ye’ll no find yours in the Abbey garden, I’m thinkin’,’
replied James, whereat the questioner looked extremely angry
and confused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> ‘I mind a bonny sang that plays&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I’ll wager, I’ll wager, I’ll wager wi’ you,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Five hundred merks and ten.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I’ll no tell ye the wager, Mistress Carmichael; I’m only a
fule, ye ken; but “I’ll wager, I’ll wager, I’ll wager wi’ you,”
that ye dinna gang oot like a ghaist in the gloamin’ just to
pu’ an apple frae a tree. There’s a canny lad wad like ill to
jalouse ye kept tryst wi’ anither; that’s just one mair to the
count. I doubt I maun be flittin’ frae Holyrood, or we a’
gang daft thegither.’</p>

<p>‘What does he mean?’ exclaimed Mary Beton, all the
duenna aroused within her as she marked the fool’s cunning
looks, and her comrade’s obvious discomfiture.</p>

<p>‘Hooly an’ fairly, Mistress Beton!’ exclaimed Geddes,
with whom the Queen’s principal lady was no great favourite.
‘Keep your ain breath to cool your ain brose. Will you
grudge the lasses their bit ploy, an’ keep back all the Joes to
yersel’?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“She wad na hae a Lowland laird,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nor be an English lady.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They’ll no threep that on you, Mistress Beton. Na, na; ye’re
a true Scotchwoman; an’ it’s just a spoilin’ o’ the Egyptians,
as godly John Knox wad call it. Troth, ye’ve made a fule
o’ a wiser body than yoursel’, I’m thinkin’. I’ll no grudge
Maister Randolph the cap an’ bells, but he’ll get the fee an’
bountith a’ gate the like o’ him gangs, I ken fine. Aweel!
ten fingers an’ ten taes, I canna number the fules at Holyrood;
for I’m no gude at the countin’, and I canna tell mair
than a score; but I’ll gang my ways to the border the morn,
for the trade is just over-stockit.’</p>

<p>‘You give your tongue too much liberty,’ said Mary Beton,
who was considerably displeased at James Geddes’s indiscreet
allusions, and not disposed to conceal her disapproval. ‘You
presume on the Queen’s good nature. Have a care; if I
mention your conduct to the master of the household, you
will be taken to the porter’s lodge to taste of Robin Hamilton’s
discipline once again!’</p>

<p>The fool’s face grew livid, and an ugly gleam shot from his
heavy eye. There was evidently some rancour brooding in
his heart against the tall porter, who, it may be, in virtue of
his office, had been ordered ere now to inflict corporal punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
on the jester. He fell to cursing the Hamiltons with
the unmeaning malevolence of insanity. From the proud
duke and his unfortunate son, whose state of mind should
indeed have obtained immunity from a fellow-sufferer, to the
stalwart gate-keeper, he called down upon all who owned the
name every evil that madness could imagine, or hatred suggest,
and then, stopping suddenly in his curses, he moved
awkwardly across the room to where Mary Hamilton, buried
in thought, sat somewhat apart from the rest, and seizing the
hem of her garment, began mouthing and kissing it, and
wetting it with his tears, in a reaction of feeling which, sustained
by one so imbecile, it was pitiful to behold.</p>

<p>As they are given to unaccountable and deep-rooted aversions,
to gratify which they have been known to display incredible
sagacity and cunning, so these unfortunates are
capable of strong attachments, cherished with a morbid vehemence
peculiar to their malady. A madman’s affection and a
madman’s hatred are alike to be avoided, since the former is
as inconvenient as the latter is dangerous.</p>

<p>James Geddes entertained a devotion for Mary Hamilton
which amounted to idolatry, and was never so well satisfied
with himself, or so nearly rational, as when employed in some
trifling commission for the beautiful maid-of-honour. Also
he watched her as you may see a dumb animal watch every
look of its owner, and was especially jealous and irritated if
he fancied she bestowed too much notice or favour on any
one else.</p>

<p>‘What is he driving at?’ exclaimed Mary Seton, observing
that the fool, although with an expression of deep contrition,
was now indulging in a series of mysterious winks and signs.
‘Ask him, Mary Hamilton. He seems to have some secret
understanding with you. Ask him, for pity’s sake, my dear;
he’ll have a fit if he goes on like that.’</p>

<p>But her curiosity was not destined to be satisfied; for at
this juncture a page entered the apartment with a summons
for Mistress Hamilton to attend the Queen; and that lady
departed accordingly, leaving her half-witted adorer in a state
of woeful penitence and discomfiture. Crouching among the
embers in the hearth, he hid his face in his hands, rocking
himself to and fro, and ‘crooning,’ in a sing-song voice, a succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of broken unintelligible sentences. From these fits of
dejection the ladies knew it was impossible to arouse him.</p>

<p>The Queen was seated at a massive oaken writing-table, on
which she was heaping together a quantity of letters and
papers when Mary Hamilton entered. A single lamp shed
its light upon her fair brow, which seemed to-night heavy
with an unusual load of care. Her features wore the languor
of mental fatigue, and even her attitude denoted the listlessness
of one who is wearied by too much thought and study.
She had been writing to her cousin of England; and if it was
a difficult matter to be well with Elizabeth at best, how much
more so now when her suspicions were excited and her jealousy
kept continually awake by the question of succession!
The maiden Queen was not without that strange weakness of
humanity, which so disquiets itself as to what shall become of
its earthly possessions when it is gone&mdash;an anxiety no stronger
in the monarch who has a kingdom to bequeath than in the
old woman who has hoarded her forty shillings in a stocking.
Will it affect them so much in that spirit-world, even if they
learn it, to know that the dynasty has been changed, or the
funded property squandered, or the entail cut off?</p>

<p>There is many a man now living who would rather lose an
arm or a leg than think that the old avenue will be cut down
when he is gone to a land where the trees of life and knowledge
flourish in perennial verdure, and all the while young
Graceless, his heir, is scanning their girth and substance with
a wistful consciousness that the Jews <em>must</em> be paid at last.
Horace has told us something about those ‘dreaded cypresses,’
which we would fain ignore. They will wave over our dwelling
when the oaks in the park have been disposed of at so
much per foot, and the family tree itself is withered and forgotten.
Do you think it matters much to Smith deceased,
the tenth of his illustrious line, that Brown should have succeeded
to his place and property, or that B. should cede in turn
to Jones and Robinson? ‘A plague o’ both your houses!’
All this, however, has nothing to do with the house of Tudor.</p>

<p>Independent of the natural aversion entertained by every
right-minded woman for another of her own sex who is sought
after by a multitude of suitors, Elizabeth had a variety of
excellent reasons for disliking the Queen of Scots. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was considerably her junior, unquestionably more beautiful
and accomplished, gifted with that mysterious fascination
which makes women angry and men foolish, and in addition,
to these offences was indubitably the next heir to the English
crown. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that
the maiden Queen should have delighted in heaping difficulties
across the path of her widowed cousin, and this was done the
more effectually by keeping well with her to all outward
appearance, and interchanging a constant succession of rings,
precious stones, letters of courtesy, and the like insidious
compliments.</p>

<p>Nor was Mary deceived by these artifices. It is probable
that she clearly perceived the hollow nature of her kinswoman’s
friendship, and returned it in kind, so far as her open generous
character would permit. But it was not in this Queen’s
nature to cherish lasting feelings of ill-will, and she had also
doubtless the good sense to see that in her precarious position
Elizabeth’s favour was essential to her security and support.
So she corresponded with her regularly in a vein of cordial
affection, amounting even to familiarity, and it is no wonder
that Mary rose from the composition of one of these letters
with an air of unusual exhaustion on her lovely face.</p>

<p>‘Help me to seal these packets, my dear,’ said she to the
maid-of-honour, as the latter approached her table; ‘my
fingers are perfectly stiff with holding a pen. No wonder my
forefathers esteemed the art of writing a disgrace, and swore
that the grasp of a noble hand should never close on anything
lighter than a lance. I often wish I was a man, to wear steel
on my breast and at my side!’ While she spoke she stretched
her beautiful fingers, which did indeed look far too delicate
to wield any weapon heavier than a needle, and pushing the
state seal across to her maid-of-honour, threw herself back in
her chair, as if thoroughly tired with her day’s work.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton occupied herself at once about her task,
affixing the seal of Scotland, with its lion rampant and its
crown-royal, to document after document, in a graceful,
womanly way that attracted the Queen’s notice, and caused
her to regard her favourite maid-of-honour with more attention
than common.</p>

<p>The latter was always pale, and unusually quiet in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
demeanour, but of late she had become paler than ever, and
her customary repose of manner had subsided into dejection.
Without obvious ailment, she looked listless and out of spirits,
languid in her movements, and far too grave for one so young.</p>

<p>Herself wearied and harassed, it struck the Queen particularly
to-night, and she could not forbear noticing it.</p>

<p>‘You are ill, Mary,’ said she, ‘and worse than that, you
are unhappy. What is it? there is something the matter!’</p>

<p>‘Nothing, madam,’ answered the other, looking up with a
transparent effort at cheerfulness. ‘How can I be unhappy
when I am at Holyrood, and near your Majesty?’</p>

<p>She did not say it in the complacent tone of a courtier, but
with a warmth and sincerity that could not have been
assumed, her large dark eyes moistening and shining in the
lamplight. She thought she loved the Queen better than
anything on earth, and so she did&mdash;save one.</p>

<p>‘I know you are fond of me, child,’ answered the Queen
affectionately; ‘that does not make me the less anxious about
you. I think of all my Maries you are the most dependent
upon me. Have a care, my dear! there seems to be a fatality
about Mary Stuart. Those who love me best seem ever to be
the most unfortunate.’</p>

<p>She spoke mournfully, and in an abstracted tone. Was
she thinking of her dead bridegroom who had worshipped her?
of the mother who had doated on her? of the loyal and brave
and the true already proscribed, banished, or disgraced? was
it memory or foreboding, the sorrows of the past or fears for
the future, that thus so often cast a gloom over her spirit, and
damped her royal courage at her need?</p>

<p>‘Do you think that would not make me love you ten times
more?’ exclaimed the other with a flash from her glorious
eyes that lighted up her whole face. ‘Can there be love
without sacrifice, madam? Nay,’ she added in a sadder
voice, ‘can there even be love without suffering?’</p>

<p>‘You are very young to say so,’ answered the Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> ‘two
years younger than I am; and I remember how I used to
think that sorrow was the especial heritage of the old. I
have learnt otherwise now; but you, Mary Hamilton, you
whom I have always watched and sheltered as a bird shelters
its nestling under its wing, what can <em>you</em> know of suffering?’</p>

<p>The maid-of-honour looked wistfully at her mistress while
she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I never can know real sorrow, madam,’ she said, ‘nor real
suffering; because I have a refuge more secure than even a
queen’s favours, and to that refuge I betake me whenever
grief becomes too heavy to endure. Ah! madam, they may
take everything from us here, but they cannot rob us of that;
this world is sometimes very dark and sad, but the light is
always shining just the same, far away at home.’</p>

<p>The Queen looked at her with concern and surprise. What
could it be, this engrossing sorrow which cast its shadow over
a young life that ought to have shone so hopeful and so
bright? The girl must be very unhappy, she argued, to be
so devout. Alas! that it should be so; that religion, instead
of the pride of the strong, should so often prove but the
refuge for the weak. And yet it is but one more instance of
that mercy which knows no limit. The happy and the pious,
too, enjoy indeed a favoured lot, but human nature is so
warped, that in the majority continuous prosperity produces
hardness of heart, and for these it ‘is good to be in trouble.’
When they have lost all (it matters not what constitutes it,
fame, wealth, or affection) they run for consolation, like a
child in distress to a parent, where it never is denied; and
which of us is there who does not know how unspeakably
precious is the balm of kindness to a bruised and empty
heart? A few there are on whom adversity has a contrary
effect&mdash;rebellious spirits, not without force of character and
capacities for happiness, who become froward and desperate
under the rod. Woe be to them! What shall bring such as
these back to the fold? Human forbearance would say ‘let
them go in their wilfulness to destruction!’ but it is well for
us that it is not with human forbearance we have to do.</p>

<p>The Queen of Scots herself was of a gay and hopeful disposition,
one which perhaps it required many reverses to steady
and sober down. Plenty of them she sustained ere all was
done! In the meantime her kind heart was moved to think
that her maid-of-honour should have some secret grief she
herself could not alleviate.</p>

<p>‘Tell me, dear,’ said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> ‘what it is that thus weighs upon
your spirits, and takes the colour out of your cheek. I have
seen it for long. Confide in me, not as your Queen, Mary
Hamilton, but as your mother or your elder sister. I too am a
woman, a failing, weak-hearted woman like the rest. I can only
imagine one cause for such deep-rooted sorrow, and yet I cannot
think my beautiful Hamilton should be in such a plight. Is it,’
and the Queen too looked confused while she asked the question,
‘is it some unfortunate&mdash;some unrequited attachment?’</p>

<p>The maid-of-honour blushed to her very temples, and the
lustrous eyes that had been gazing fondly into the Queen’s
face were lowered for an instant; but she raised them with an
effort, and drawing herself up, with her colour deepening
every moment, answered proudly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam; we Hamiltons have your own princely
blood in our veins, and do not give our love unasked or unreturned.
The Maries, too, follow their Queen’s example, and
would deem it worse than unmaidenly to entertain a secret or
unacknowledged preference. We hold our heads high, you
know, madam, like our mistress.’</p>

<p>The Queen looked as if she did not quite agree with her,
and was about to answer, when a soft strain of music rose
from the Abbey garden, and arrested the attention of each
lady as if by a charm. The casement was thrown open, and
the night wind stole in, bearing with it the melodious tones
of a lute struck by no unpractised hand, and the notes of a
rich voice that each seemed to recognise simultaneously with
mingled embarrassment and delight.</p>

<p>There was then a proverb current in Scotland, which the
poet seemed to have embodied in the verses he now poured
forth on a flood of harmony:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mary Stuart and Mary Hamilton looked at each other in
amazement. The former laughed sweetly.</p>

<p>‘It is our minstrel come back again,’ said she, ‘and as welcome
as he is unexpected. He has not forgotten the art in
his absence from the inspiration.’</p>

<p>While she spoke she shifted the lamp from the writing
table to the window shelf, where its flame was sheltered from
the breeze by the unopened half of the casement.</p>

<p>The maid-of-honour answered nothing; but the Queen
could not help remarking she became very restless and preoccupied,
accepting her dismissal for the night in silence, but
with more alacrity than usual.</p>

<p>Chastelâr in the garden saw the light shifted from its place
in the Queen’s apartment, and interpreted it into an encouragement
of his own wild hopes. His heart leaped, his brain
glowed, his blood ran fire. Long absence, rational considerations,
obvious impossibility, had not quenched his folly. He
had left d’Amville, had wandered to and fro, had returned to
Scotland with no definite object but to look on the face that
haunted him night and day. He was love-mad; it mattered
not what became of him: to live or die he cared not; but it
must be at the Queen of Scotland’s feet.</p>

<p>Though it was mid-winter, the sun shone brightly as in
June. The bold outline of Arthur’s Seat cut against a
cloudless sky; and a light air from the opposite coast of Fife
cleared the Firth of its accustomed vapours, and brought out
in fair relief the smiling bays and noble headlands of its
romantic shores. Far to the eastward, where a white sail
glistened in the sun, loomed the bluff island of the Bass,
poised, as it seemed, in mid-air by the magician’s art, so imperceptibly
were sea and sky blended together in the distant
horizon; while beyond it, North-Berwick Law reared its cone
above the undulating line of coast that stretched away to the
southward till it faded from the sight. To the west, the
wooded shores, the jutting promontories, and the sparkling
water, combined to form a scene such as men imagine in their
dreams, shut in by the dark glades of Hopetoun and Dalmeny,
dim, rich, and beautiful, like a glimpse of fairy-land.
With the castle of her strength crowning her comely brow,
the old town sunned her terraced streets and high fantastic
buildings in the warmth of noon, looking down, as it were,
with proud protection on the smooth lawns and dainty
gardens that adorned the palace of her kings. Like some
rare jewel, carved, rich, and massive, resting on a velvet
cushion, lay the square edifice of Holyrood on its green and
level site. Though the stately towers and delicate pinnacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of the Abbey were in deep shadow, the sun shone gaily on
the Queen’s Park beyond, crowded as it was with masses of
spectators and glittering with the brightest and fairest of the
Scottish nobility.</p>

<p>Barriers had been placed in this well-selected spot, lists
for the exercise of chivalry carefully laid out, and galleries
erected for the fairer portion of the assembly, whose applause
was destined to encourage the competitors and reward the
successful.</p>

<p>The Queen and her maidens occupied the most prominent
of these stages; but Mary Stuart, true to the warlike predilections
of her blood, descended from her position of advantage,
and, followed by her train, proceeded in person to
examine the arrangements for the pastimes, and the dress
and horses of those engaged.</p>

<p>Loud acclamations greeted her as she passed through the
crowd. Though habited in mourning, as was her custom,
that bewitching face did not fail to produce its usual effect,
even on the strictest of the Reformers. Here and there,
indeed, some severer dame might shake her head and purse
up her lips in obvious disapproval of her sovereign, but such
demonstrations were confined to the female sex, and only to
the oldest and ugliest of <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>The tournament of the Middle Ages had ere this period
fallen into disuse. Gunpowder had already taught the
warrior that his cumbersome array of mail and plate was no
secure defence, and although he had not yet discarded corslet
and head-piece, he was already beginning to learn the lesson
of modern warfare&mdash;that sagacity is as important a gift as
courage, and agility a more effective quality than strength.
Perhaps also the untoward accident that, within a few years,
had deprived France of her monarch, served to bring the tournament
into disrepute; and the Scotch, who, beside their
tendency to imitate French manners, were then, as now,
somewhat of utilitarians, need not have been long in arriving
at the conclusion that such conflicts were a waste of strength,
courage, and mettle, both in man and horse.</p>

<p>Riding at the ring, however&mdash;an exercise requiring perfect
horsemanship and great dexterity in the use of the lance&mdash;long
remained a favourite amusement amongst the young Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lords. It was no easy task to carry off, on the point of a
spear, a ring scarce two inches in diameter, suspended from a
slackened cord, whilst moving at a gallop; and the cavalier
whose hand, eye, and seat were alike perfect enough to accomplish
this feat, would have been a formidable antagonist in the
crash of a real encounter&mdash;man to man and horse to horse,
armed <i>cap-à-pie</i> in steel.</p>

<p>On the present occasion the amusement partook somewhat
of the character of a masque. The two Lords Stuart, in defiance
of Mistress Alison Craig’s prophecy, had not found themselves
so tamed and spirit-broken by marriage as to give up
their favourite occupations, and had been instrumental in
setting on foot the pageant which had now collected so motley
a concourse in the Queen’s Park. Six gallants disguised as
amazons, had resolved to hold the lists against other six disguised
as savages, the victory to be decided by success in
carrying off the ring. The Queen herself had given the prize
to be contended for&mdash;a gold heart of exquisite workmanship,
and a purse filled with broad pieces. To add to the interest,
a dozen of ladies chosen by lot, amongst whom were the Queen
and the Maries, had been entreated to select each one a champion,
and it was partly for this purpose that the train of female
beauty, with Mary Stuart at its head, now wound in and out
amongst the barriers which enclosed the lists, together with
the domestics and horses of those who were about to ride.</p>

<p>As she approached one of the savages, who was already in
the saddle, and poising his lance in his hand, the Queen
started and turned pale in obvious distress. She would have
passed him without notice, but the rider, whose wandering
eye and excited gestures denoted that he ought not to be at
large, reined his horse across Her Majesty so as to oppose
her progress, and casting his lance at her feet, demanded to
be chosen her champion and her true knight.</p>

<p>The Queen drew herself up and looked really angry.</p>

<p>‘This is too much!’ said she. ‘How far has the Earl of
Arran’s loyalty and good conduct been so pre-eminent that he
can dare to claim this proud distinction? By the laws of
chivalry every lady has the right to her own choice, and here
is mine.’</p>

<p>The Queen pointed to the nearest horseman as she spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
He was richly dressed as an amazon, and his glowing complexion
and regular features would have done no discredit
even to one of those female warriors. She had selected him
at random as a proper rebuke to Arran’s insane presumption,
but, like many another act of her life, it was as untoward as
it was hasty. Chastelâr, for it was none other, sprang from
his horse, and knelt in acknowledgment at the Queen’s feet,
laying his lance down at the same time before her in an attitude
expressive of humility and adoration.</p>

<p>‘To the death!’ exclaimed the poet, literally kissing the
hem of the Queen’s garment ere he sprang once more into the
saddle and forced his horse in a series of managed bounds to
the farther extremity of the enclosure.</p>

<p>One of the maids-of-honour looked disappointed and distressed.
Mary Hamilton would fain have selected the Frenchman
for her champion during the day, a distinction which
would probably make him her partner also in the ball at
night.</p>

<p>As the ladies passed on, the Queen’s half-brothers, both
habited as amazons, approached Her Majesty, dragging between
them, with shouts and laughter, a lad of some sixteen
summers, whose fair, beardless face was indeed blushing like
a girl’s.</p>

<p>‘Choose him, madam!’ exclaimed the merry lords, in a
breath, while the younger, with a comical affectation of
womanly reserve, spread his gilded buckler before the lad’s
crimson cheeks. ‘George Douglas has never lifted spear
before; he is indeed a redoubtable champion for a queen.’</p>

<p>Tears of shame and vexation started to the boy’s eyes, yet
he looked pleadingly at his sovereign, as if with a confused
hope that the great ambition of his life might be realised.</p>

<p>Mary was always gentle and considerate. She smiled on
him encouragingly.</p>

<p>‘It is mettle that makes the man-at-arms,’ said she. ‘I
would have chosen you, indeed, young sir, had these merry
gossips of yours brought you to me sooner. Never mind, you
shall ride to-day for Mary Hamilton.’</p>

<p>The young eyes glistened with pride and happiness; the
young heart swelled. Those few kind words had riveted it
for ever to the cause of Queen Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The English Ambassador, who, in compliance with the
directions of his Court, mingled in all the amusements at
Holyrood, and who was as skilled in arms as in policy, now
presented himself before the ladies. Mr Randolph’s costume,
as one of the six savages, was remarkably well-chosen and
appropriate. A bear-skin hung from his shoulders, and he
had decked himself and his horse with wreaths of holly, of
which the red berries were strung and looped together as
savages wear their beads. He dropped on one knee to
Mistress Beton, craving permission to carry her good wishes
with him in the ensuing courses; and Alexander Ogilvy, in
the dress of the opposite party, looked on and wished he was
an ambassador too, or at least might woo that haughty dame
so frankly without fear of a rebuff.</p>

<p>The lace on Mary Beton’s collar vibrated with pleasure as
she bowed a gracious affirmative. In truth the stately lady
was insensibly beginning to take no small pleasure in the
attentions of her diplomatic admirer.</p>

<p>Mary Seton, in the meantime, had been inspecting with
sarcastic scrutiny the persons and accoutrements of all the
competitors. With a stinging jest or biting retort she had
refused to accept the homage of one after another, and
finally took as her knight one John Sempill, an Englishman,
who had sought refuge at the Court of Holyrood, a plain,
silent man, who appeared somewhat surprised to find himself
in a scene of merry-making, and whose only recommendation
in the eyes of the maid-of-honour must have been that he was
the direct opposite of herself.</p>

<p>There was yet one of the Maries who had not chosen her
champion. All unconscious that there could have been a
witness to her <i>rendezvous</i> in the Abbey garden, Mary Carmichael
rejected candidate after candidate, in hopes the right
one would apply at last. With a brighter eye and a deeper
colour than usual she followed in the train of her mistress,
and more than one gallant observed that he had never seen
Mistress Carmichael to such advantage, and were it not for
the Queen, she would carry off the palm of beauty from all
upon the ground.</p>

<p>But the eye grew dim by degrees and the colour faded,
as Walter Maxwell, habited like a savage, remained aloof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
standing apart, busy with the caparison of his horse, and
obviously anxious to avoid notice and conversation. A
sleepless night had somewhat paled his cheek, but otherwise
his look was as composed and reserved as usual. A manly
nature is as much ashamed of disclosing mental suffering as
physical pain.</p>

<p>The girl was puzzled; she could not understand him:
yesterday, so kind and loyal and frank; to-day, so distant
and calm and cold. Had he been the most experienced
carpet-knight that ever made war upon the sex, instead of an
honest, true-hearted soldier, he could not have adopted a
better method of aggression. She had never felt so much
engrossed with him in her life. It is hardly fair to fight a
woman with her own weapons; but we imagine it discomfits
them exceedingly, the more so that they are well aware a
man’s coldness, unlike their own, is the result of real displeasure,
and the forerunner of a rupture.</p>

<p>Eventually all the ladies had chosen but Mary Carmichael;
all the horsemen were selected but Walter Maxwell. She
detached herself from the rest, and walked to where he was
standing apart, still fastening his bridle and caressing his
good horse.</p>

<p>She tried to speak in an easy, off-hand manner; but a duller
ear than his might have detected the forced tone of her voice.</p>

<p>‘They are mounting,’ said she; ‘you will be left out.
Will you not be my knight?’</p>

<p>‘For to-day,’ he answered, bowing low, and with a strained
courtesy more galling than actual rudeness.</p>

<p>Then he too sprang into the saddle and galloped off to
join his comrades. The girl bit her lip till the blood came;
tears of shame and vexation rose to her eyes; and yet she
had never liked him so well as at this moment.</p>

<p>The Queen with her ladies now returned to the gallery,
from whence she could have a good view of the sports, dispensing
once more amongst the crowd that good-humoured
notice which is so fascinating from a sovereign. Many a
reflective Scotch face smoothed its rugged brows as she
passed; many a stern Protestant who followed weekly the
vigorous discourses of John Knox with approval in proportion
to the strength of their doctrine, and attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
never diverted for a moment from the profound casuistry
of their arguments, looked after her with a wistful, pitying
admiration, as though loth to believe such a creature of
light could be a chosen tool of the arch-enemy, and a
vessel of wrath doomed to everlasting perdition. The
younger members of the crowd blessed her audibly, while
here and there some godless jackman, ruffling it in all the
audacious freedom of inebriety, swore loudly that it was his
profession and his pastime to die for the Queen.</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray and his bride occupied the next seats
to the royal household. Matrimony had not altered the
composure of the deep-scheming earl. His own attire and
that of his lady were of the gravest and most sombre,
rebuking by their austere simplicity the bravery of the
Queen’s immediate attendants.</p>

<p>Moray, while he kept well with the Court, was careful not
to offend the prejudices of the strict Protestant party, in
whose ranks he felt lay his chief strength, and while he
smiled with a melancholy forbearance on the gaieties of his
brothers and his royal half-sister, he never forgot for an
instant the character he had assumed, of the rigid guardian
and upholder of religion; the man in whom the ‘country
might have confidence,’ the prop and stay of ‘the godly’
through the length and breadth of Scotland. His bride,
a comely, laughing lass when she married him, was obviously
taming down, day by day, to the required pattern of decorum.
Like some flower denied the sunlight, she was
fading from her youthful colour and brightness, into that
premature old age which is so pitiful to witness&mdash;the
waning of the heart and feelings before the face is wrinkled
or the locks are gray.</p>

<p>And now the crowd are driven from the enclosure by a
score of men-at-arms wearing the royal livery. As these
push their well-trained horses amongst the foot-people, much
elbowing and squeezing is the result. The <i>lads</i>, as Scotchmen
are termed up to the most advanced period of life, bear
the jostling good-humouredly enough; the lasses laugh and
shriek, and display extraordinary unsteadiness, and an unusual
craving for protection and support. But the lists are
cleared at last, and the troop of mounted masquers come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down like a whirlwind, in line, till they reach the Queen’s
gallery, when they wheel to right and left from their centre,
and sweeping round at the same pace, take up their
respective positions at either extremity of the lists.</p>

<p>In Her Majesty’s gallery eager eyes are watching their
movements. The Queen and her ladies criticise both steeds
and horsemanship pretty freely, wagering gloves and trinkets
on the result, but Mary Carmichael sits pale and silent, and sees
everything in a mist, because she cannot keep back her tears.</p>

<p>The ring is up, and borne off fairly by several of the
cavaliers. All acquit themselves with knightly prowess, but
some of the horses are unsteady, and Lord John Stuart
shooting at a gallop past the object, of which he has only
struck the outer edge, encounters amongst the spectators the
laughing face of Mistress Alison Craig.</p>

<p>‘Fie on ye!’ exclaims that unabashed dame, loud enough
for the discomfited nobleman to hear; ‘an’ ye ride no better
than that, ye’ll never wear the orange and black in your
bonnet again on Leith Sands!’</p>

<p>He cannot choose but laugh as he recalls his prowess the
year before among the citizens while carrying the colours of
the mercer’s daughter, and Mistress Alison with becoming
modesty puts down her wimple to hide the cheek that has
long since forgotten how to blush.</p>

<p>At last Mr Randolph, young George Douglas, Walter Maxwell,
and Chastelâr, alone remain to contest the prize. One
failure withdraws the competitor, and but these four have
borne away the little circlet at each attempt with graceful
skill. The excitement amongst the ladies increases visibly,
and there is an obvious feeling in favour of the handsome
child, for he is scarcely more, who wears on his amazonian
helmet the Bleeding Heart of the House of Douglas.</p>

<p>The crowd, too, cheer the boy lustily. The people have
alternately loved and feared the Douglas since the days of
‘Good Lord James,’ but their Scottish hearts warm to that
grand old line, and the lad’s youth and beauty are sure to
tell on such an assemblage as the present. He flushes to
the eyes and casts a look at the Queen’s gallery, then couches
his lance and drives his horse furiously to his course.</p>

<p>Hand and seat and eye, all are true enough, but he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
going a little too fast, and the glittering object is missed by
a hair’s-breadth. As he leaps from the saddle at the end of
his career, the boy bursts into tears, and withdraws to hide
his face amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr Randolph also fails, but with a grace and dignity that in
Mary Beton’s opinion are more creditable than success itself.</p>

<p>Chastelâr, who, to the natural dexterity of a Frenchman,
has added the skill acquired by constant practice, once more
carries off the ring, and glances proudly at the Queen as he
brandishes it aloft on the point of his lance.</p>

<p>Again it is Maxwell’s turn to try his fortune. Mary
Carmichael’s heart beats painfully. If he wins the prize,
how will he act? By all the laws of chivalry he must lay
the ring at her feet, and she must deliver him the costly
trophy. Already she anticipates the moment of triumph.
Shall she enjoy it coldly and with dignified displeasure,
making him as unhappy as she has been herself? No; she
longs to forgive him, and be friends. All these disquietudes
are wholly unnecessary; as he arrives within a stride of the
object, his horse falls, rolls over him, and both disappear in a
cloud of dust. Mary Carmichael utters a faint shriek, and
then sits cold and rigid like a statue. At this moment the
Queen discovers the secret of her maid-of-honour.</p>

<p>Chastelâr then turns his horse round, carries off the ring
once more, and lays it at the Queen’s feet, his dark eyes
flashing with excitement.</p>

<p>With the graceful courtesy that becomes her so well,
Mary presents the prize to the successful competitor.</p>

<p>‘One more trophy,’ says the Queen, ‘to the Troubadour,
who wins all hearts by the sweetness of his songs, and who
wields the lance as successfully as the pen.’</p>

<p>Chastelâr strives to speak in reply, but his voice fails him
and he turns ashy white. Mary Hamilton watching him
from behind her mistress almost expects him to fall from his
horse. He recovers himself after a short interval, and
mutters a few unintelligible sentences; then opening the
purse, scatters its contents amongst the multitude, and
dismounting, falls upon his knees, and replaces the heart in
the Queen’s hands.</p>

<p>‘Will you not keep it, madam,’ says the poet, in a hoarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
broken voice, ‘a tribute from the humblest and most
devoted of your worshippers; fitting emblem of all Chastelâr
has to give? A pure heart of sterling gold is the most
appropriate offering that can be presented to the Queen of
Grace and Beauty.’</p>

<p>Somewhat unprepared for the compliment, Mary accepts
it with a little confusion, and the crowd, shouting loudly,
testify their approval of the generosity as well as the prowess
displayed by the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Some discontent has indeed been manifested at the success
of a foreigner, but the freedom with which the broad pieces
have been scattered about has rapidly converted all invidious
demonstrations into cordial applause. On such terms they
would gladly see him win hearts and purses every day.</p>

<p>Though stunned and shaken for the moment, Maxwell
was not seriously hurt. After changing his costume for his
ordinary attire, he rejoined the party of gallants and ladies
that had congregated round the Queen. A fall with a
horse is no very serious affair to an accomplished cavalier in
the pride of youth and strength; his bearing was as composed
as usual, and save a mischievous glance from Mary
Seton, and a little short speech of condolence in which good-nature
and sarcasm were strangely mingled, little notice was
taken of his mishap. While the Queen, however, whose
French education had not destroyed her predilection for
pedestrian exercise, made her way back to the palace on foot,
followed by her train, Mistress Carmichael lingered behind
the others till she found herself next to the fallen cavalier,
and as he walked on for a time without speaking, she
summoned up courage at last to take the initiative.</p>

<p>‘I must condole with my knight,’ said she; ‘he did his
part well, and had his horse not failed him I think we should
have carried off the prize.’</p>

<p>She spoke with a constrained effort at playfulness, and
was conscious that her heart beat very fast the while.
Whence came this new feeling of subjection? She never
used to be afraid of him like this.</p>

<p>‘I should like to have won it for <em>your</em> sake,’ he answered,
but very coldly and gravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> ‘You and I will have but
little in common, Mistress Carmichael, after to-day.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ she gasped, thoroughly frightened
now, and too anxious to be indignant; but ere he could reply
the train of courtiers had already dropped back to them, and
Mary Carmichael was compelled to join her companions with
a weight of grievous apprehension at her heart.</p>

<p>Another sentence might perhaps have cleared up everything,
or at least put an end to doubts and misgivings; but how
could he speak it with a score of the sharpest ears at Court
ready to catch every syllable as it fell? Perhaps an explanation
might never arrive, or if it did would come too late; perhaps
pride might rise up to prevent it, or the opportunity
never occur at all. And thus originate half the misunderstandings
and estrangements that embitter the whole existence of
those who, could they but speak three words to each other
alone, would never doubt or mistrust in their lives again.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Floods of light were again streaming through the lofty
halls of Holyrood. Music was pealing loud and harmonious
above the ringing of wine-cups, the clatter of a banquet and
the merry din of voices. Massive plate, emblazoned with the
royal arms of Scotland, glittered on the board; silks, satins,
and jewels shone and sparkled around it. In goblets of gold
the red wine bubbled to the brim, and stately heads were
bent, and bright eyes glistened while gallants laughed and
whispered, and ladies blushed and smiled. All that luxury
could lavish, all that refinement could require, enhanced the
splendour of the feast. Tall, elaborate devices of architecture,
mythology, and fancy, peering from amongst winter plants and
flowers, decked the tables; whilst the very claws of the pheasants
and moor-fowl were gilt ere they were served; the peacock
roasted, yet not despoiled of his sleek plumage, offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a lordly delicacy; and the boar’s head, garnished with rosemary,
grinned its fierce welcome with the customary apple in
its mouth.</p>

<p>At a cross-table, behind a huge candelabra, shedding a refulgent
light on her features, and in front of a sideboard piled
with rich plate and burnished trenchers, till she seemed literally
enshrined in gold, sat the Queen, with the most distinguished
of her nobility on either hand. Her face was radiant
with animation, for pomp and pleasure were not without their
charms to her impressible nature; and her manner, as her
guests could not but observe, combined inimitably the cordiality
of the hostess with the dignity of the sovereign. Her
Maries were placed at the adjoining tables, and more fortunate
than their mistress, had at least the chance of sitting
next those individuals in whose conversation they took especial
pleasure. These lotteries, however, are very apt to turn
up an unreasonable proportion of blanks, and while Mary Carmichael
could not even see where Walter Maxwell was supping,
and Mistress Beton, to her dismay, found herself placed three
seats off from the English Ambassador, Mary Hamilton alone
saw the seat next her occupied by the person whose society
she liked best in the world, and none but herself knew how
she trembled when her cup was filled by the poet Chastelâr.</p>

<p>Is it not always so? We take incalculable pains to prepare
for our festivities; how anxious we are that they should <em>go off</em>
well; how engrossed is the butler with his plate-basket and his
ice-pail; how concerned the host that my lord’s venison should
not be overdone. Every plait must be laid to a hair’s-breadth
in the glistening tresses of the lady of the house. Two mirrors
satisfy her, at last, that folds and flounces and flowers are
still adjusted to a nicety, but still there weighs on her mind
the list of precedence, and the probable contingency that the
most important guest may not turn up at all. Perhaps it may
come across even her conventional mind that there are games
for which it is scarce worth while to purchase such expensive
candles, and that a two o’clock dinner with the children is a
more agreeable repast, after all. Ay! even at the best, there
is a speck on the <i>épergne</i>, an earwig in the flower-basket, a
flavour of wormwood in the liquid amber called champagne.
<i>Surgit amari</i> over and over again! Perhaps it was not so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that banquet of which the halt and the maimed and the blind
were invited to partake. Perhaps there are no insects in a
dinner of herbs; no heart-burnings in the crust we share with
hunger; no bitter drop in that cup, though it be but cold
water, wherewith we pledge celestial charity, and ‘entertain
an angel unawares.’</p>

<p>Chastelâr was flushed and preoccupied; thus much was
apparent to the eyes that watched him with such eager interest.
Ever and anon he glanced uneasily towards the royal
table, but ere long something he noticed there seemed to give
him intense satisfaction, and filling his goblet to the brim, he
devoted himself, like an accomplished gallant, to his fair
neighbour. Such is the nature of his sex. A woman always
feels a little humbled when she thinks she has been too gracious,
even towards a favourite; a man, on the contrary, though
his affections may be fixed elsewhere, considers it due to himself
to be as captivating as he can. And then they talk of
female vanity and female love of admiration.</p>

<p>‘I was sorry for my young knight to-day,’ said Mary
Hamilton, not, it must be confessed, very truthfully, and
without raising her eyes to her companion’s face. ‘Poor
boy! he would have been so pleased to win. I wish he had
carried off the prize.’</p>

<p>Chastelâr could not forbear giving her a meaning look.</p>

<p>‘And yet you did not choose him,’ he said. ‘He was given
you by the Queen. Did he really carry your good wishes with
him, Mistress Hamilton? I marvel his lance could fail; if I
had thought that, mine would hardly have been so steady.’</p>

<p>He scarce knew what he was saying. Flushed with success;
intoxicated with his own wild happiness; excited as
such imaginative natures are by music, lights, wine, and
beauty, he was in that reckless mood which drains pleasure
eagerly from every cup, and thinks not of to-morrow.</p>

<p>‘You are jesting with me,’ she answered, in a low, trembling
voice.</p>

<p>Oh! had he known how these light words of his thrilled
to that kind unsuspecting heart, he would have spared her for
very pity’s sake.</p>

<p>‘Nay, fair mistress,’ he replied, gaily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> ‘I do not jest with
<em>you</em>; there are some with whom to break jests is like breaking
lances, sharp-pointed ones, too, and ending in a combat
<i>à l’outrance</i>. I am afraid of you, Mistress Hamilton.’</p>

<p>‘Why so?’ she asked, looking up at him with her clear,
guileless eyes. ‘Am I so very formidable? You do not seem
much afraid of anything to-night.’</p>

<p>A gleam of triumph shot from his eyes, and once more he
glanced towards the upper end of the hall, then lowering his
voice, he whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>‘There are contests in which to win is as perilous as to lose.
There are lists in which the true knight fights unarmed whilst
his adversary is clothed in steel. Give me my <i>coup-de-grâce</i>,
Mistress Hamilton,’ he added, with a bright smile, ‘I must
depart now to prepare for the masque. Before I go I yield
me “rescue or no rescue.”’</p>

<p>‘You have a merciful jailer,’ was all she could trust herself
to reply; but as he rose from his seat and left the hall, Mary
Hamilton’s eyes followed him with a wistful, longing gaze,
and Mary Hamilton’s heart thrilled in her bosom, with a keen
sense of pleasure that was not far removed from pain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the banquet progressed merrily, not uncheered
by those lively strains that have made Scotch music, from time
immemorial, so appropriate to all scenes of merry-making or
excitement. Wine, too, flowed freely, for the stalwart barons
would, indeed, have deemed themselves wanting in respect to
their sovereign had they stinted their accustomed measure
because they sat at a queen’s table. Thirsty souls they were,
some of those iron old paladins, and quaffed such mighty
draughts as their degenerate descendants would scarce believe;
but it was observed that those among them who were most
liberal in their potations, became also graver, more dignified
and sententious, in proportion to the quantity they imbibed.</p>

<p>Here and there a vacant seat might be perceived, as
several gallants quitted the feast by stealth to prepare for
the coming pageant, which was tacitly conceded to be a
surprise.</p>

<p>Ere long the lower tables, at the extremity of the hall, were
drawn, and their occupants, gathering round the royal circle,
began to display that flutter of expectation which pervades all
assemblies when there is anything to be seen.</p>

<p>Presently two grave ushers with white wands threw open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the folding-doors, and, amidst peals of laughter from the
men, and exclamations of astonishment, not without a shriek
or two, from the ladies, in rushed a troop of satyrs, and commenced
clearing a space in the middle of the hall for the
further exhibition of the performances.</p>

<p>These masquers were in uncouth and fantastic disguise:
their flesh-coloured coverings were adorned with wreaths of
oak-leaf and ivy; horns sprouted from their brows; goat-skins
covered their nether limbs, which terminated in cloven
feet; and long tails depended from their backs, which they
brandished in their hands, and used as whips to clear a passage
in the throng.</p>

<p>The Queen clapped her hands, and laughed aloud. ‘None
but Sebastian could have plotted this,’ she exclaimed. ‘Come
hither, ’Bastian, that we may thank thee for thine ingenious
device.’</p>

<p>The satyr thus summoned, who seemed indeed the leader
of the rest, and no mean representative of the god Pan,
approached the royal presence with quaint reverence, beating
a measured dance with his cloven feet, and brandishing his
tail the while.</p>

<p>James Geddes, the fool, in an irrepressible state of excitement,
could not forbear imitating his gestures with a grotesque
fidelity that provoked shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>Sebastian, somewhat irritated, and taking advantage of his
position, struck at him viciously with his tail; but the fool,
familiar with such salutes, dodged it adroitly, and the blow
fell across the shapely leg of the English ambassador, who
winced, and turned crimson with the pain.</p>

<p>Mr Randolph, however, had far too much self-command to
betray his anger, which was little alleviated by the laughter
that the Queen could not repress.</p>

<p>‘How now?’ quoth the statesman, trying hard to force a
smile; ‘is Pan like Atropos, that he spares neither Wisdom
nor Folly, but smites down all alike?’</p>

<p>‘It’s the knave aye gets the fule’s arles,’<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> remarked James;
‘or he wadna be siccan a knave; an’ it’s the fule aye tynes<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
them, or he wadna be siccan a fule!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Wages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Losses.</p>

</div>

<p>And so speaking, he sat composedly down at the Quee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>n’s
feet, pulling a grimace at the same time that was too much
even for the Earl of Moray’s gravity.</p>

<p>The satyrs then proceeded to enclose a space for the coming
masque. So thorough was their disguise as to baffle even the
keen eyes of those who were most interested in their identity;
and as the sylvan monsters ranged themselves on each side
the hall, soft voices behind them whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Are you Sholto?’ or, ‘It <em>must</em> be Archibald!’ to receive
no more satisfactory answer than a stifled laugh.</p>

<p>A flourish of music now announced the continuation of the
pageant, and the three planets, Mercury, Mars, and Venus,
made their appearance, habited in robes of silver gauze and
spangles: the first, winged strictly according to mythology at
head and heel; the God of War, armed with glittering helmet,
flashing buckler, and greaves of burnished gold; and the
Queen of Beauty, represented by young George Douglas,
extremely embarrassed with her draperies, and blushing as
Venus surely, save on one memorable occasion, never blushed
in her life.</p>

<p>These representations of the starry host were then succeeded
by the Nine Muses, all in different colours, and, notwithstanding
their beardless faces and classical folds, displaying
legs unusually muscular for Muses, and also a good
deal more limb than is customary with that sex to which the
‘tuneful Nine’ are supposed to belong.</p>

<p>Melpomene, too, could not forbear laughing outright;
Clio, albeit the daughter of memory, forgot whether she was
herself or Urania; and Terpsichore, somewhat flushed with
sack, caught her feet in her petticoats, and narrowly escaped
the indignity of entering the royal presence on her head.
They trooped off, however, after making their obeisance to
the Queen, and ranged themselves in front of the satyrs on
either side the hall.</p>

<p>After them a score of cavaliers, mounted on the well-known
hobby-horse, of which the sweeping housings concealed its
rider’s real legs, whilst his false ones dangled outside in
ludicrous union with its gambols, plunged and frolicked into
the apartment. Half were represented as huntsmen, half as
heathen Turks, and they blew their horns, or brandished their
scimitars, with an energetic gravity edifying to behold. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
truculent-looking Saracen earned immortal honour by the
life like manner in which he backed his hobby-horse the whole
length of the hall, and then caused it to rear straight on end
ere he took up his position, counterfeiting inimitably the
coquetry of the practised rider, and the repressed mettle of
the unwilling yet obedient steed. Some of the courtiers
whispered that it was Lord John Stuart; others, the Grand
Falconer; not a few believed it to be the Warden of the
Marches in disguise; but the better informed were all the
time aware that it was no less a personage than Her Majesty’s
head cook.</p>

<p>Then came pilgrims decked with sandals and scalloped
shell, leading with them bears, wolves, tigers, and an occasional
unicorn; all these quadrupeds presenting alike the
anomaly of a pair of hind legs jointed the wrong way, but
performing their parts in other respects with decorous fidelity,
and an obvious difficulty in keeping up with their leaders.
These were succeeded by musicians bearing lutes, harps, wind
instruments, and guitars, dumb indeed in reality, but going
through all the motions of a lively measure, which the Queen’s
real musicians were playing for their encouragement.</p>

<p>Next came two little cupids armed with silver bows and
baldricks, their rosy limbs uncovered, and their golden curls
mingling with the wings of gauze that stood from their
shoulders. Pretty urchins they were, but somewhat too
young for their task, and already rubbing their sleepy eyes
with dimpled little fists. Hand in hand, they trotted into
the hall boldly enough, but ere half the distance was accomplished
their hearts failed them; they stopped, looked about
them, and one began to cry. This was too much for his
little companion’s philosophy, who incontinently followed his
example, but both were immediately caught up by some of
the ladies, and quickly caressed into composure. The Queen,
too, had them brought to her forthwith, and soothing them
with kind words and sweetmeats, sent them to bed happy
and consoled.</p>

<p>During this unexpected interlude, the principal feature of
the pageant, and one which had tasked to the utmost the
ingenuity of its contrivers, now entered the hall. It consisted
of a fleet of ships constructed of light wicker-work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and moved upon wheels, which were worked unseen from
within. The sides of these galleys were formed of cloth,
coloured to represent beams of cedar, fastened and inlaid
with gold; the masts and spars were gilt, the tackle of silver
tissue, and the sails of gauze. A murmur of admiration
greeted the pageant as it glided up the hall with the stately
motion of ships sailing over a smooth sea.</p>

<p>On the deck of each bark stood an unknown lord, dressed
with the utmost magnificence, and closely-masked. So
resolved were these silken pirates not to be identified, that
their doublets, their hose, and even their gloves, were padded
so as to conceal the shape of their figures, their limbs, and
their very hands. They were known to be gallants of the
Court, but that was all. The nobles laughed and applauded,
their dames whispered and speculated, when, with a burst of
music rising into loud, triumphant tones, the ships increased
their speed, and the leading galley, closely followed by the
rest, bore swiftly down upon the circle which contained the
Queen and her ladies, with obvious intention of a capture.</p>

<p>Each masquer took a partner by the hand, and courteously
entreated her in dumb show to enter his gorgeous bark. The
Queen first set the example of compliance, and amidst shouts
of admiration the barks veered round, and, doubly freighted,
floated once more proudly down the hall.</p>

<p>Then the squadron divided, the sails were furled, the
voyagers disembarked, and each gallant kneeling low as he
gave his hand to his companion and helped her to alight, unmasked
at the same instant, while the music changing to a
merry lilt, the couples found themselves arranged in due
order to tread a well-known measure called ‘the Purpose,’ on
the polished floor.</p>

<p>This ‘Purpose,’ as it was called&mdash;a word which signified
confidential conversation&mdash;was a dance resembling the cotillon
so popular with our grandmothers, and not entirely despised
to-day when lights are waning after a night of festivity, and
gloves are soiled, and flowers faded, and cheeks begin to pale
before the coming dawn. Then is the moment to infuse
fictitious vigour borrowed from excitement into the closing
scene&mdash;then the careful mother at the emptying doorway, with
shawl and wrapper on her braceleted arm, waves her unwelcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
summons to the bounding damsel, warmed up into
bloom once more, and every turn is precious now because
every turn must be the last. Then shall the prey, which has
been playing round it all night, gorge the glittering bait for
good and all. Wind up the reel, in with the tackle, out with
the landing-net&mdash;goldfish or gudgeon, he is gasping helpless
on the bank; but had it not been for the cotillon, he might
have been wriggling his tail even now in derision through the
elusive waters, might have despised the fire and ignored the
frying-pan to this day.</p>

<p>The ‘Purpose’ was so called because the figure exacted
that at stated intervals the couples should dance together
through the doorway into an adjoining room, and having
made the circuit of that apartment, should return, unbosomed
of any secrets they might have had to interchange, to the rest
of the laughing company. It was a figure obviously adopted
for the triumph of coquetry, and the discomfiture of mankind.</p>

<p>The leading pirate had dutifully borne off the Queen, and
when he unmasked, Mary discovered that Chastelâr was to
be her partner in the dance. The poet’s manner was more
full of deference than usual, but there was a light of unearthly
happiness in his eye.</p>

<p>Randolph had secured Mary Beton, nothing loth. That
very morning the ambassador had received instructions from
his Government to leave no stone unturned till he had discovered
the Queen’s predilections amongst the numerous
marriages that were proposed to her, all and each of which
gave Elizabeth such disquiet. He proceeded now deliberately
to sound her principal maid-of-honour, under cover of making
fierce love to her himself.</p>

<p>With the loud music and the long intervals of inaction
there was ample opportunity for the process.</p>

<p>‘We shall soon have nobler doings even than these,’
observed Mr Randolph, whispering confidentially to his
partner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> ‘when another royal wedding gladdens the walls of
Holyrood. Shall we dance the Spaniard’s bolero, or the
Austrian’s gavolte, or our own old English brawl? Whatever
be the measure, Mistress Beton, my only hope is that we
may dance it together.’</p>

<p>Randolph looked very tenderly at her while he spoke, and
his partner’s ruff heaved visibly.</p>

<p>‘Nay; you statesmen are too premature,’ she replied.
‘Ladies are not to be thus wooed and won in a day, much less
queens. The Archduke, Don Carlos, Lord Robert&mdash;which of
them can be called a fitting mate for our Sovereign? You
must not hurry us thus, Mr Randolph; you are indiscreet.’</p>

<p>‘And cannot you guess why I am so anxious for your mistress
to marry?’ whispered the insidious statesman, pressing
nearer to his listener. ‘Is it not that alone which will free
her beautiful maidens from their self-imposed celibacy? Till
that auspicious day even our thoughts are not our own, and a
man of honour must be tongue-tied on the subject nearest his
heart.’</p>

<p>Mary Beton blushed and trembled. It was almost a declaration,
and from that impenetrable and capable man! The
staid maid-of-honour was losing her head every moment.</p>

<p>‘It may come sooner than any of us think,’ she murmured,
giving him her hand to lead her, as the dance demanded, on
their tour through the rooms. ‘Sooner than any of us
desire,’ she added, with a sudden resumption of her usual
stateliness.</p>

<p>He pressed the hand affectionately, and his voice became
exceedingly trusting and confidential. Mr Randolph was a
man who never hesitated to waste a sprat for the purpose of
catching a salmon.</p>

<p>‘It will not be Lord Robert,’ said he; ‘I can tell you that,
though it is as much as my life is worth. But I would trust
you with my head, beautiful Mistress Beton&mdash;far rather than
my heart,’ he added, in a low fond voice; ‘were it not indeed
too late to make that reservation.’</p>

<p>The light seemed to swim in Mary Beton’s eyes, and the
music was like surging water in her ears. A true woman,
despite her natural caution and her court education, she
returned confidence for confidence.</p>

<p>‘They do talk of a bridegroom,’ she whispered. ‘It is a
secret, Mr Randolph; but I feel I am safe with you. The
Countess of Lennox has already suggested her son, and I
think the Queen is not averse to the idea. If it <em>should</em> ever
be,’ she added, with rising colour and some hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> ‘we
shall be differently circumstanced, of course; and, in short,
the future must always be uncertain for us all.’</p>

<p>He replied with less warmth than she perhaps expected;
but his commonplaces were extremely polite, nay complimentary,
and when he led her back to the company, there
was that complacent expression on his countenance, which is
worn by a man who finds in the hand dealt him the leading
card of the game.</p>

<p>Far different was the ‘Purpose’ entertained by Walter
Maxwell and Mary Carmichael, in their interval of conversation.
With the frank kindliness of his nature, that honest
gentleman had determined at least to ask an explanation, ere
he condemned at once and for ever the woman he felt he still
loved only too well.</p>

<p>With this intention he had joined the merry band of masquers,
though his heart was sadly out of tune for mirth,
and had carried off his mistress without hesitation from the
fair circle who were waiting to be abducted. Nay, when he
unmasked, and Mistress Carmichael, who had recognised him
from the first, stole a look at his face, it wore its usual grave
but kindly expression, and the displeasure which had so
discomfited her all day, and spoilt her gaiety all night, had
entirely disappeared. He was determined to be just and
kind and temperate in his dealing with her, though more than
life depended on the result.</p>

<p>When he spoke it was in a low, soft voice, but every syllable
was strangely emphatic and distinct.</p>

<p>‘I behaved unkindly in the Queen’s Park,’ said he, ‘but I
was hurt and offended at your conduct. Had I not cause?’</p>

<p>She blushed, yet her eye was bright with repressed
exultation.</p>

<p>‘How have I offended you?’ she asked, quickly. ‘I
would not do so willingly, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you different from the others,’ he resumed, with
more agitation. ‘In common charity I ask to be undeceived.
Did I not see you in the Abbey garden the night before
last?’</p>

<p>She trembled all over, but looked him full in the face
nevertheless, yet so scared, so startled.</p>

<p>‘What then?’ she murmured, in obvious agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You were not alone,’ he continued, with a severe brow;
‘who was your companion?’</p>

<p>She drew a long breath as if immensely relieved, nay, she
almost smiled as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Then, you do not know? you cannot even guess?’</p>

<p>‘Had I known,’ he answered, significantly, ‘it would not
have been the lady I should have questioned.’</p>

<p>She raised her head haughtily.</p>

<p>‘And by what right do you question the lady now?’ she
exclaimed. ‘Am I answerable to Walter Maxwell for my
conduct? I take leave to think, sir, you might be better employed
than in watching my movements.’</p>

<p>He was growing very angry and consequently calmer every
second.</p>

<p>‘You had rather give no explanation?’ he said, with
studied politeness.</p>

<p>She bowed her head in silence, but the colour was fading
faster and faster from her cheek.</p>

<p>‘You decline it,’ he added, still very low, but through his
set teeth.</p>

<p>‘Distinctly!’ answered the lady, adding, as only a woman
would at such a moment, ‘You are neglecting the figure, the
dance is going on without you.’</p>

<p>After this the pair derived but small gratification, we
imagine, from the amusements of the evening. Walter Maxwell
took the earliest opportunity of departing to cool his
irritation in the night air, whither, as we dislike seeing a
strong man wrestling with pain, we will not follow him.
Mary Carmichael, however, bore her part bravely to the end;
and although her answers were at times a little absent, and
her laughter somewhat misplaced, none could have guessed
by her outward bearing that she had so recently seen the
great stake of her life’s happiness set, played for, and lost.
She was not the only gambler in the hall. There was one
heart amongst those dancers within a few yards of her that
had resolved to-night to play the great game in which the
odds were incalculably against it, and which to lose was ruin
entire and irretrievable. There were a couple now gracefully
moving through the figure of ‘the Purpose,’ as the music
swelled and sank in triumphant harmony or pleading sweetness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of whom one was enjoying unconsciously the gratification
of the moment, gay, kindly, generous, and impressionable,
yet calm and dignified because thinking no evil, and the
other with beating heart and swimming brain was steeped to
the lips in the intoxication of that madness which comes but
once in a lifetime, and seems to have but one fatal and invariable
result.</p>

<p>Woe to the idolater! It is written on the tables of stone:
Woe to the idolater! Be the image what it may, wood
brass, or marble, or one ‘a little lower than the angels,’ whom
the worshipper must needs exalt above the Being to whom the
heavenly Host itself is but as dust in the hollow of a man’s
hand. The punishment shall not come from abroad; it shall
not be wrought by foreign enmity, nor owe its keenest pang
to foreign injustice. If so, the sting would be extracted; the
vengeance incomplete. No; Dagon alone shall crush the
deluded votary who grovelled at Dagon’s pedestal. It is the
hand he trusted that shall strike him to the heart, the feet
he kissed that shall spurn him in the dust. When he shall
have stripped himself of all to do his false god service; when
he shall have lost his friends, his wealth, his fame, his self-respect,
and forfeited his honour, and pawned his birthright,
then, and not till then, shall the image of stone rock and totter
and fall upon him and crush him to powder. Were there no
world but this, it would indeed be better for that man that he
had never been born.</p>

<p>The Dagon of to-night was fair to look on, queenly and
graceful and gloriously beautiful. It seemed unnatural to
refuse her homage; it seemed ecstasy to kneel and supplicate
and adore. The worshipper was in the wildest stage of his
idolatry. He looked for no greater glory than to lay down
life and heart and soul at her feet.</p>

<p>What good results could come from such a link between
the lovely Queen of Scotland and the infatuated minstrel of
France?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘He either fears his fate too much,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or his deserts are small,</div>
<div class="verse">Who dares not put it to the touch,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To win or lose it all.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mary Stuart still wore in her bosom the gold heart
that had been won by Chastelâr in his victory of the
day. This it was that had so elated him at the banquet;
this it was that gave him courage in the dance to speak
words of love to his Queen.</p>

<p>The distant music had subsided to a low, plaintive strain;
the apartment into which, in their turn, the two had seemed
to float upon those floods of melody was bathed in a subdued
and softened light; the odour of perfumes loaded the atmosphere;
and the sounds of far-off revelry did but add to the
languor and seclusion of the scene. Mary’s cheek was a
shade paler and her step scarce so buoyant as usual. She
seemed fatigued, and whilst awaiting the louder peal of music
that should summon them back to the dance, the Queen
seated herself on a low chair near the doorway, and fixed her
eyes upon the floor with a dreamy, listless gaze. Chastelâr
remained standing, bent over her chair as if fascinated, spell-bound.
The music sank lower and lower, and they were
alone!</p>

<p>At last the Queen raised her eyes to his, and what she saw
there brought the blood reddening to her brow. It broke the
charm, however, and the poet found his voice to speak,
though his lips trembled so that he could scarcely form his
words. He knelt before her as he would have knelt to a saint.</p>

<p>‘Ah! madam,’ he exclaimed in broken accents, ‘accept my
homage, my thanks, my everlasting gratitude. This is the
day in Chastelâr’s life that he had better lay him down and
die in his great happiness, for the sun can never shine on
such another for him again.’</p>

<p>She smiled on him, half-kindly and half-pitiful.</p>

<p>‘Why should you thus thank me, Chastelâr?’ she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
‘What have I granted to my Troubadour that is not richly
merited by one so loyal, so devoted, and so true?’</p>

<p>She spoke lightly and playfully, yet was there a tone of
repressed feeling in her voice. No woman alive could have
looked unmoved on the depth of intense devotion that glowed
in Chastelâr’s face.</p>

<p>‘Ay, madam,’ he replied, ‘you have ever been kind and
condescending and gracious to your slave. You know not
what your notice is to him: how he watches every turn of
your face, and hangs on every word of your lips. What the
blessed sunlight is to creation&mdash;its hope, its love, its pride,
its whole existence&mdash;such is your presence, O Mary! O my
Queen! to me.’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ she replied, half-rising from her seat, and looking
round as though not caring that their dialogue should be overheard;
‘nay, Chastelâr, how you are trenching on your own
prerogative, and wasting on my solitary ear the materials for
a sonnet which should delight the whole Court. I cannot
listen to such compliments from my Troubadour, save in
verse.’</p>

<p>‘You will listen to them thus,’ he exclaimed, eagerly.
‘You will allow me to lay at your feet a volume I have long
wished, but not dared, to pray you to accept. May I experience
this great happiness? Is it a promise?’</p>

<p>She bowed her fair head in acquiescence, and her colour
went and came. Queen though she were, Mary Stuart was
also a woman to the heart’s core; and it was not in woman’s
nature but to experience a tinge of gratification and triumph
in an authority so despotic, a dominion so complete as this.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the permission, he hurried on:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I would lay all I have&mdash;my fame, my happiness, my life,
nay, my very soul&mdash;at your Majesty’s feet, and thank and
bless you, even did you trample them to dust. O madam!
have you not read of such devotion? can you not believe in
it? Do you not <em>know</em> that there may exist a love so pure,
so holy, so self-denying, that its blessing and its privilege is
to give all and ask for nothing in return?’</p>

<p>Again she looked around her, startled and confused, but
there were no listeners near. Still the strain of ‘the Purpose’
stole soft and low and soothing on her ear. She resolved she
must never hear him speak again like this; but the moments
were all the more precious at the time. It would be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
unkind to check him harshly now. He was madly in love
with her, no doubt; and his punishment would come quite
soon enough: meantime, she thought it better to treat the
whole affair playfully.</p>

<p>‘I too can write verses,’ said she, with a bright smile.
‘Shall I repeat you a couplet or two I composed to-day?
They are not amiss, Chastelâr, at least for a queen! and considering
they are in rhyme, they are tolerably true&mdash;too true,
I fear; the more the pity. Listen, Troubadour, and take a
lesson in your own trade; moreover, beseech you, mark the
moral, for that is the whole merit of the stave:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘And yet, madam, there are chains that the slave hugs to
his bosom,’ answered Chastelâr, gazing on her with looks of
imploring affection; ‘there is a labour of love that is sweeter
than the profoundest repose; there is a pain that we prize
and cherish, clasping it tighter and tighter till it pierces to
our hearts, and so we die.’</p>

<p>‘Such chains I would not lay on <em>my</em> servants,’ said the
Queen: ‘such labour I would never impose; such pain I
could not bear to inflict.’</p>

<p>He looked up brightly.</p>

<p>‘Say you so, madam?’ he replied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> ‘then indeed do you
give me new life, and something to live for. You graciously
accepted that trinket from me to-day; and the proudest
moment of my existence was when I saw it on your breast
to-night; that gold heart is but an emblem of mine own; it
is yours, my Queen, if you will deign to take it. Do with it
what you will; keep it, or break it, or cast it scornfully
away.’</p>

<p>He took the Queen’s hand as he spoke, and pressed it fervently
to his lips; but he had gone too far, and Mary, rising
from her chair, snatched her hand from him, and drew herself
to her full height.</p>

<p>‘You forget,’ she said; ‘you must surely forget where we
are, and to whom you speak! This is Holyrood, Monsieur
Chastelâr, the royal palace of the kings of Scotland; and I am
Mary Stuart, its mistress and its Queen. Lead me back, sir,
to the dancers; the music warns us; and do not expect to be
forgiven if you should so far presume again.’</p>

<p>She spoke angrily, yet some feeling of compunction smote
her the while; and perhaps she was not quite so angry as she
looked. She gave him her hand to lead her back to the
dance with lofty condescension; and it was remarked on her
return to the hall, by more than one acute observer, that the
Queen seemed to have quite recovered her fatigue, and that
her colour was deeper, her glance brighter, and her step firmer
than during the earlier part of the evening. One pair of eyes,
too, that never left him save when they met his own, that
shone with liquid lustre when he was present, and filled many
a time with unbidden tears when he was far away, gazed
wistfully on Chastelâr to-night, and a fond heart wondered
why his face was so pale, and his manner so dejected and
wild and sad.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton was one of those characters less rare in her
own than in the stronger sex, with whom, to use the poet’s
expression, ‘love is its own avenger.’ For such, happiness,
when it does come, should indeed be intense, for their sufferings
are acute, their doubts harassing, their self-depreciation
unsparing in proportion to the abandonment with which they
merge their whole existence in that of another. It is good to
love for those who can love <em>wisely</em>, but, alas! for the self-inflicted
tortures of the heart that loves <em>too well</em>.</p>

<p>The revel was at its height; louder and louder pealed the
music, faster and faster flew the dancers; all seemed bent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the enjoyment of the hour, and resolved that the concluding
scene of the festival should be the wildest and merriest of the
night. To look at those panting forms, flushed cheeks, bright
eyes, and floating tresses, who would have believed but that
here, if anywhere, was to be found the gaiety that flings itself
without reservation into the pleasures of the moment? Who
would have thought there could be room for care or sorrow
in the fair bosoms heaving proudly under pearls and gold, or
detect the ring of spurious metal in the joyous tones that told
of gratified vanity and partial approbation, and careless,
thoughtless mirth?</p>

<p>It is better to leave your partner when you have shawled
her deftly at the door; there she bids you a cordial, perhaps
even a tender ‘good-night’ with her mask on, the same mask
you always see, that is painted in such a radiant smile. It
comes off though in her dressing-room, when the aching
temples are released from their garland, and the shining tresses
are unbound, and the being that you have envied as a model
of good sense, gaiety, and content, sits her down with a weary
sign, and dismissing you and your platitudes, with which she
seemed so highly delighted, from her thoughts, leans her head
upon her hand, while the hot tears trickle through her fingers
for the sake of somebody you never saw or heard of, who is
far, far away.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are even with her; perhaps you, too, meeting
her gloved hand in the dance, wince under the senseless exterior
which you assume with your evening clothes, in painful
consciousness that you cannot quite forget a Somebody of
your own, the very rustle of whose dress was music to your
ears in the olden golden days that are spent and vanished like
a dream; ay, though you seemed so gay and caustic and
<i>debonair</i> in the cloak-room a while since, when you walk out
into the night, the stars you loved to watch for <em>her</em> sake long
ago, look down upon you more in pity than reproach, and the
sighing wind reminds you, as it never fails to do, of the
gentle face that was all your trust and treasure once, that is
lost to you now for evermore. There is no need for you to
hum the refrain of that beautiful song, wailing for ‘the tender
grace of a day that is dead.’ Are you likely to forget it,
clinging as it does about your heart like ice, and chilling you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to the marrow even now? Never mind! you have ‘done
your ball’ handsomely and creditably, both to self and partner;
it matters little that you are a couple of well-dressed hypocrites,
covering your respective sores under broadcloth and
Mechlin lace; you have offered your incense at the conventional
altar; you have sacrificed religiously to society; you
are at liberty to take off your trappings now, and wash the
paint from your wan faces, and go both of you away by yourselves,
to be as wretched as you please.</p>

<p>The Queen and her Maries danced on, fresh and gay to the
very last. Even the musician’s well-trained fingers seemed
less untiring than the ladies’ feet. But the revel came to an
end soon after midnight, and the sentinels at the palace gates,
relieved at that hour, glanced admiringly after the noble
groups that departed in quick succession; some of the older
and statelier forms, be it observed, walking with a more staid
and solemn air than usual, attributable to the excess of the
Queen’s hospitality, and the excellence of the French wines
that graced her table.</p>

<p>There were two individuals, however, now strolling away
arm-in-arm with an appearance of great cordiality, who never
suffered their brains to be heated beyond their self-control, and
who, relying on their wits as the good swordsman on his blade,
were careful to keep those weapons constantly bright and
keen and tempered for immediate use. They were engaged,
even in this friendly promenade, in a kind of moral fencing-bout,
with muffled points indeed, and bloodless intentions,
yet such as should prove to each his adversary’s strength
against the future possibility of a real encounter.</p>

<p>Said Mr Randolph to Secretary Maitland&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The revel hath indeed sped gaily. I never witnessed a
merrier even at the English court, where my royal mistress
hath always given so hearty a welcome to the Lord of Lethington.
The masques were quaint, the music exquisite, the
supper beyond all praise. Holyrood was indeed to-night one
blaze of splendour.’</p>

<p>‘And our Scottish ladies?’ asked the Secretary, who had
not failed to observe his companion’s attention to Mistress
Beton, and, suspecting his design, glanced curiously at his
face to gather what he could from that inscrutable volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The Firth down yonder sleeping in the moonlight, could
not have been less unruffled than the Englishman’s countenance;
nevertheless, his language was too enthusiastic to be
sincere.</p>

<p>‘They are above all praise,’ said he. ‘Were I one of those
soft-headed, iron-handed paladins of fifty years ago, I would
break any number of lances in maintaining your Queen and
her Maries to be the brightest bevy of beauty in Christendom!
But those follies went out with the mass to make room for
others! And, by the way, what thinks worthy Master Knox
and his godly party of all this feasting and fiddling and
mummery?’</p>

<p>‘There is a strong feeling of religion amongst our townsfolk,’
was the guarded answer, ‘combined with loyalty to Her
Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Then they desire to see her wedded,’ resumed Randolph.
‘It rejoices me to hear this, guessing, as I think I can, at the
Queen of England’s wishes. Frankly now, and between
friends, hath your beautiful Mistress no predilection for any
of her wooers?’</p>

<p>‘I am only a statesman,’ answered Maitland, laughing. ‘I
can fathom a plot or an intrigue; but a woman’s schemes are
far too deep for me. I believe, however, that on this subject
ladies are not prone to speak their real minds.’</p>

<p>‘Lord Robert Dudley is a stanch Protestant?’ proceeded
Randolph, interrogatively; ‘and a comely, personable nobleman
besides?’</p>

<p>‘Would your mistress like to part with him to mine?’
said the other, with increasing mirth. ‘If Dudley aims at a
crown-matrimonial, Mr Randolph, he need not cross the
Tweed to fetch it, or we are strangely misinformed in the
North.’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ answered the Englishman, ‘I will be frank with
you. The Maiden Queen would be loathe to resign either
title. But it is not on her marriage that the eyes of all Protestant
Europe are fixed. The destiny of the Reformed
Church will be strongly influenced by Mary Stuart’s choice
of a husband.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>‘She will be guided doubtless in this, as in everything, by
the wishes of her people and the advice of her royal cousin,’
was the diplomatic reply. ‘The Austrian and the Spanish
match are alike distasteful. The Archduke is a greybeard,
and Don Carlos a puling, sickly boy. You see, I can be
candid with you. Our Queen will have none of these.’</p>

<p>Mr Randolph, in common with the general public, had
known this important disclosure for weeks. It was his cue,
however, to accept the communication for somewhat more
than it was worth.</p>

<p>‘As we are in confidence, then,’ he continued, ‘I will
round in your ear an idea of mine own. What if the Scottish
Queen should unite herself to one of her own blood, and of
suitable years, thus avoiding all foreign influences, the while
she does no violence to her natural inclinations?&mdash;a goodly
young gentleman, of honest nurture, and of the Reformed
religion. Surely such a mate could be found amongst the
noble families in both kingdoms.’</p>

<p>It was a leading suggestion, from which Randolph hoped
to gather a corroboration of Mary Beton’s intelligence; but
he had to do with one as skilled in state-craft as himself, and
equally unhampered by compunctions as to truth or sincerity.</p>

<p>‘There is none that I can think of,’ replied Maitland, with
an air of such exceeding candour that the other felt convinced
he was telling him a lie&mdash;‘unless it be young Lord Darnley;
and there are so many objections to his claim, that although
it has often been considered, it has never been entertained for
a moment. Is it possible that it would meet with your Court’s
approval?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot answer without instructions,’ said Randolph,
laughing: and wishing each other ‘good night,’ the well-matched
pair separated, without either having gained a decided
advantage in the encounter of their wits.</p>

<p>The Laird of Lethington, indeed, who had been acting on
the defensive, was satisfied with his own reticence, although
his suspicions were aroused, and the eternal question, ‘What
is he aiming at?’ that haunts the diplomatist, followed him
to his pillow; but Mr Randolph was puzzled and discomfited.
He could not piece his information together as he liked into
one of those perfect specimens of workmanship which he
delighted to forward to Secretary Cecil for the inspection of
his Queen. Nevertheless he sat up far into the night, writing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
state-paper to the English grand vizier, and when it was
finished, such is the inconsistency of man, dwelt with considerable
complacency on the handsome stately image of the
lady who had suggested it. The road to power is not often
strewed with flowers. Mr Randolph had no objection to
gather them when he could do so without going out of his
way, though he was the last man to keep them when withered,
or indeed care for them one jot after the first freshness was
off their bloom.</p>

<p>But what were the musings of a weary courtier, or even
the misgivings of a baffled diplomatist, to the tide of anxiety
and anguish that surged through the overwrought brain of
Chastelâr, till the poet felt as if he must go mad? Alas!
for the gift, dangerous as it is brilliant, of a vivid imagination
acting on a deep and tender heart. There are certain insects
in the tropics, with which, unconscious of the cruelty, ladies
are wont to trim their dresses, that sparkle like diamonds,
when thus impaled in torture: while they suffer they glow,
and when they cease to glow they die. So it is with certain
temperaments, and those not the dullest nor the least amiable
of their kind. Their very lustre arises from the pain that is
goading them within. The flash that sets the table in a roar
springs often from an aching heart: the glowing words that
clothe immortal thoughts in godlike imagery rise to lips wet
with the bitterest draught of all. Who can describe happiness
so vividly as he who feels that it can never be his own?
Who yearns for beauty with the thirst of him to whom all
that is fairest in earth and heaven but mocks the impotence
of his despair? If such temperaments enjoy keenly, and
indeed it would be hard if they did not, they suffer with an
intensity of pain that goads them nearly to madness, and
causes them to rush into follies and extravagances such as less
ardent natures are never tempted to commit.</p>

<p>Chastelâr left the hall tortured with shame and doubt and
fear. Sometimes he wondered at his own recklessness, that
could thus risk his very existence on a word; for he felt that
if Mary were really offended, and he were banished from the
Court, he had better die. Then he taxed the Queen with
perfidy, injustice, hardness of heart. Anon, a softer feeling
argued that his offence was not of so grievous a nature after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
all, that the Sovereign might pardon and look kindly on a
confession of such devotion to the woman, nay, that it might
have been welcome to her and expected long ago. But Mary’s
image, rising from her chair in offended majesty, dispelled
this brighter vision; and though his very heart was flooded
with the remembrance of her beauty, the sense of hopelessness
that had chilled it so often, seemed to creep over him and
paralyse him as of old. At least he felt he could not bear
her displeasure. She had turned away from him when he
had sought her eye after the dance. Perhaps she was mortally
offended, and would never speak to him again. Like
all others under the same spell, he was totally incapable of
judging his own case, and saw everything in a false light.
He was even himself aware that he could no longer rely upon
his faculties, and yet he felt an irresistible impulse goading
him to action, no matter what. There is method in every
phase of madness save one, and that is the madness of a man
in love.</p>

<p>He paced his room in an agony of irresolution. At last he
made up his mind to ask the Queen’s forgiveness. He could
not sleep without it. He must have it this very night before
she retired. He bethought him of the book that she had
consented to accept. It was a happy idea: that unconscious
little volume should befriend him. He would present it to
her on his knees, and would read his sentence in the looks
with which she received the token. He was more composed
now, and felt as if he were about the most rational proceeding
in the world.</p>

<p>Acting on this suggestion, Chastelâr, with his offering in
his hand, stole softly through the gallery and up the staircase
that led to the Queen’s private apartments. The lights were
already extinguished, and none were moving in the palace,
save one or two tired domestics, loitering drowsily to bed.
With a beating heart and noiseless tread he reached the door
of an ante-room that led to the Queen’s chamber, and paused
for an instant to listen. The latch of the door clanked loudly
as he opened it, but all was dark within.</p>

<p>Whilst deliberating whether to enter or not, a light shone
along the passage, and a measured step, accompanied by the
rustle of a lady’s dress, made his heart leap to his mouth. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
this juncture, his presence of mind, which had so strangely
abandoned him all night, came back in a moment. Without
looking to identify the intruder, he laid his book upon the
door-sill, and stooping down imprinted a kiss on the threshold,
as one who takes his last leave of the shrine that guards his
idol ere he retires. In rising he encountered the Queen herself,
still in her robes of ceremony and alone. She was proceeding
from the Countess of Argyle’s chamber to her own,
and had dismissed all her attendants save the two that were
even now waiting for her in her bedroom. She started when she
saw Chastelâr, and the blood came to her cheek. Was it the
light that shone round her like a glory in the poet’s heated
imagination that produced the semblance, or was it his own
fancy, or could it be reality? He thought her eyes looked
wet with tears.</p>

<p>This was too much for his overwrought feelings. He flung
himself at Mary’s feet, and taking the skirt of her robe in
his hands, literally kissed the hem of her garment again
and again.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, madam, forgive me!’ he exclaimed, in broken
accents, and weeping like a woman or a child. ‘I could not
bear it; I could not rest; I felt I had offended you&mdash;I who
would die to give you a moment’s pleasure. I was mad! I
knew not what I did; but I crept here to lay my offering at
your feet, and to pray for your forgiveness; although you
would not know it, would never hear or heed me. Pardon!
oh! pardon me, my Queen!’</p>

<p>She could not but pity him; she who was so good and
tender-hearted and pitiful to all: his sorrow was so obvious,
his misery so complete. She gave him her white hand and
bade him rise to his feet; then she chid him gently, kindly,
with a grave sorrow on her young face, like a mother who
takes to task a dear but froward child.</p>

<p>‘You would not grieve me, Chastelâr,’ said she, ‘I know.
Not one of my Scottish subjects is more loyal and true than
my French minstrel. Give me your book; I will accept it as
a pledge of your service and fidelity to your sovereign. To
your sovereign,’ she added, with a significant look, before
which his eyes were lowered, and his whole countenance fell.
‘I am not only Mary Stuart,’ she added&mdash;and perhaps it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but his fancy made him think there was a dash of sadness in
her tone&mdash;‘I am the Queen of Scotland as well. This country,
too, is not like France; there are grave eyes watching here
to which the lightest matters are a scandal and an offence.
Enough of this. I have resolved to trust you, Chastelâr: I
will employ you in my service. You will be far from Holyrood,
but you will be fulfilling my wishes and furthering my
interests. To-morrow you will receive your instructions.
Chastelâr, I can count on obedience. Farewell!’</p>

<p>There was a tone of sorrow in her voice, and she looked on
him very sadly as she passed on into her apartments out of
his sight.</p>

<p>Though he heard her words, they were unable to rouse him;
though he saw the glance he appeared to heed it not; his
frame seemed crushed and powerless; his head was sunk on
his breast; when he lifted it, she was gone. Then he drew
himself up and looked around him like a man who wakes from
some ghastly dream. His face was very white when he walked
away, and there was a smile on it not pleasant to behold.
You may see such on the face of one who is sentenced to
death.</p>

<p>Why should he be pitied? If a man must needs sit down
to play his all, whose fault is it that he gets up a beggar? If
he grasps at the phial, though it be marked ‘Poison,’ and
drains it to the dregs, what is he to expect? Experience will
not warn the gambler, he must go to the workhouse at last;
nor reason stay the hand of the suicide, he must die like a
dog&mdash;in a ditch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘To seek hot water beneath cauld ice,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I trow it is a great folie;</div>
<div class="verse">I have asked grace at a graceless face,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But there is nane for my men and me.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen and her brother sat in grave deliberation in
her Majesty’s private apartment. Moray’s face betrayed,
under its usual composure, a sense of triumph and satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
The scheming earl had succeeded in bringing about an interview,
from which he expected great things, forgetting, as such
intriguers often do, the frank nature of his sister, and the uncompromising
character of the churchman whom he wished
her to conciliate. He glanced anxiously now and then at the
timepiece, for men of his stamp have scant leisure to spare,
and something like a smile overspread his features as he detected
a bustle in the ante-room which indicated an arrival.</p>

<p>Mary seemed absent and depressed. With her cheek leaning
on her hand, she had listened to her brother’s arguments
like one whose thoughts are far away. She was already conscious
that the burden of state-craft was too heavy for her to
bear; her young head and heart, too, were aching under the
weight and restrictions of a crown.</p>

<p>She looked up with a weary sigh when the door opened,
and a staid usher, too long schooled at court to betray surprise,
whatever he might feel, announced the entrance of Mr John
Knox.</p>

<p>The Reformer advanced with the grave, dignified air that
was habitual to him, and that sprang from no advantages of
bodily presence, but from the consciousness of unshaken integrity
within. His flowing beard and long black gown
accorded well with the severe and thoughtful brow. For an
instant, as he lifted his eyes to the beautiful face of his sovereign,
they shone with an expression of pity and admiration,
that softened his whole countenance; but the gleam was
transient, soon to make way for an increased rigidity of
demeanour, as the churchman recalled the sacred nature of his
office, and the interests he felt commissioned to represent.</p>

<p>The Queen rose when he entered and greeted him courteously.
They formed a strange contrast, that pair of disputants;
icy winter and leafy June, the budding hawthorn and
the gnarled oak-branch, the smiling sunbeam and the keen
north blast, could not have been more different. For a moment
they were silent, and scanned each other narrowly. Her
Majesty, as became her rank, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>‘I have summoned you, Master Knox,’ said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> ‘for that
I would not willingly mistrust a friend without an explanation,
or condemn a subject unheard. There is sedition abroad
in Scotland, and those in whom a Queen should put her confidence
conspire to bring her authority to nought. Master
Knox, Master Knox! can you answer to your sovereign the
heavy charges brought against you?’</p>

<p>‘To <em>my</em> Sovereign, and to <em>hers</em>,’ replied the Reformer, pointing
upward. ‘Confront me with mine accusers, madam, and
I will put them to open shame.’</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ resumed the Queen, glancing at her brother as if
for support, ‘I can judge of your sedition for myself. Have
you not written a book expressly to overthrow my just government,
wherein the casuistry and lore for which you are celebrated
have been employed for the worse purpose; but which,
nevertheless, I will commission the most learned men in Europe
to refute? Have you not stirred up rebellion, and even
caused bloodshed, in England, to sap the very foundations of
my throne? Have you not practised the black unhallowed
art of magic, rather than leave a stone unturned to further
your cruel and undutiful enmity against me, your Queen?’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ replied the preacher, not without a certain sarcastic
admiration in his tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> ‘you are skilled in the knowledge
of the schools, and for a gentlewoman tolerably familiar
with the laws of logic and the rules of disputation. I will
answer your charges categorically and in order. If to teach
the word of truth to the discomfiture of idolatry; if to exhort
the multitude to that worship of the Spirit which is alone
acceptable in the sight of Heaven; if to fulfil the commission
of <em>my</em> Master by waging war to death against the Roman
Antichrist, to hew down root and branch, and cast into the fire
the deadly upas-tree&mdash;its breviaries, its scapularies, its masses,
its mummeries, its rank blasphemous ceremonials: if this be
sedition and rebellion, I plead guilty. If princes are not
better served by those who have cast off the yoke of the
popish despot, and if subjects are not more loyal who fear
God and honour the king, than those who flatter the crown
and obey the crozier&mdash;if your Grace have not more cheerful
homage from your free Scottish people than ever your fathers
enjoyed from our priest-ridden forebears&mdash;I plead guilty. If
mine enemies can prove that one drop of blood hath ever been
shed by my influence or my consent, if they can deny that
wherever I have lived, at Geneva, in England, at Berwick, and
now in Edinburgh, it has been my constant endeavour to
inculcate the doctrines of “peace and good-will,” and God
hath so blessed my labours that they have borne fruit an hundredfold&mdash;I
plead guilty. With regard to the charge of magic,
I can the more easily bear the brunt of that indictment when
I mind me that my Master while on earth was taxed with the
same accusation. What said the priests? the priests, madam,
who like your own were fain to own all the wealth and power
of earth at the loss of heaven&mdash;“He casteth out devils,” said
they, “by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.” So far as I
have striven to walk in the footsteps of my Master&mdash;so far as
my weak unworthy efforts have been directed to follow His
example&mdash;to this also I plead guilty. But if these charges
fail, as fail they must when your Grace brings your own clear-sighted
reason to bear upon them, the verdict will be “not
guilty,” and the accusation of rebellion and sedition falls to
the ground.’</p>

<p>Mary had been listening with obvious impatience and no
very close attention. She had perhaps made up her mind
beforehand. She had again seated herself, and tapped the
floor fretfully with her foot, glancing occasionally at her
brother as if to ascertain his opinion of the controversy.
Moray looked on with the calm approval of a partisan, who
thinks his own man is getting the best of it. When Knox
paused, the Queen broke in with unusual vehemence.</p>

<p>‘And the book? At least you cannot deny the book, nor
its object, nor its reflections on my mother and myself. Even
the nice casuistry of Master Knox cannot refine away his
authorship of that “First Blast of the Trumpet against the
Monstrous Regiment of Women.” Oh! it is a worthy title
for a worthy production! and, in any other country under
heaven but this, it would have brought its writer to the block.
By the crown I wear, in a parallel case, my cousin of England
would have had it burnt by the common hangman!’</p>

<p>She breathed quick, and gesticulated more than was her
wont. She was lashing herself into anger, the gentle Queen,
as she thought of her own weakness and Elizabeth Tudor’s
strength. Knox met her glance unmoved. When thus embarked
on the tide of argument, he was no more to be influenced
by force than persuasion; the softest eyes that ever
smiled, and the sternest brows that ever frowned, were alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to him. In the pride of his calling, and the fierce delight of
disputation, a man of marble within and without.</p>

<p>‘As to the book that so angers your Majesty,’ said he, ‘I
own to it freely. Yes, I wrote it deliberately, and on reflection;
nor is there a position laid down, nor an argument
adduced in the whole of it, that I fear to establish and substantiate
before any ten of the most learned men in Europe!’</p>

<p>‘Then you maintain that I have no just authority even
over my own subjects?’ urged the Queen, with difficulty
keeping back her tears.</p>

<p>‘These are all fair matters for dispute, madam,’ was his
reply. ‘The learned may surely be suffered to discuss such
questions unmolested, when they refrain from putting their
theories of good government into practice. Plato himself, as
I need scarcely remind your Majesty, argued the necessity of
many reforms fundamentally opposed to the very principles
of the commonwealth in which he lived. The <i>litera scripta
manet</i> indeed, madam; but it is for future generations; and no
book written, if left unfortified by persecution, ever yet subverted
the authority existent at the time it was composed,
and against which it may seem to have been aimed. Besides,
madam,’ added the churchman, warming into good-humour
as he got into the full swing of his oratory, ‘my book was
not directed so much against yourself as your namesake, the
bloody Jezebel of England, with her wicked satellites, godless
Gardiner and blaspheming Bonner, the one on her right hand,
and the other on her left! Had I meant to have troubled
<em>your</em> estate, madam, would I not have chosen a more fitting
time, and a weaker breach in the defences, for my assault?’</p>

<p>‘But at least,’ resumed Mary, a little mollified by this admission,
‘ye cannot deny that ye have taught the people to
follow a religion different from that of their prince. How is
this to be reconciled with the divine command that subjects
should obey their rulers? I cannot wrestle with you in argument,
Master Knox; I am but a foolish woman after all; yet
here, methinks, I have you on the hip.’</p>

<p>He paused a moment, like a true rhetorician, gratified at an
opposition he deemed worthy to be controverted.</p>

<p>‘The objection, madam,’ he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> ‘is a fair one; yet
thus do I demolish it. True religion, it cannot be disputed,
cometh from God, and not from the king, else why are we
enjoined but to honour the latter, whilst we are to fear, and
consequently obey, the former? This is the argument positive.
Of the negative, I can produce instances in abundance.
The following may be thought sufficient:&mdash;The Hebrews were
not to conform to the idolatry of Pharaoh or the self-glorification
of Nebuchadnezzar the King, nor were the primitive
Christians to practise the degrading superstitions of the Roman
Emperors.’</p>

<p>‘Good,’ replied Mary; ‘yet we read not that Jew or Christian
was justified in resisting with the sword.’</p>

<p>‘The Almighty had not seen fit to give them the power,’
answered Knox.</p>

<p>‘Then you hold that subjects are entitled to take up arms
against their sovereign,’ proceeded Mary. ‘In good faith,
Master Knox, this is a dangerous doctrine even in these lawless
times.’</p>

<p>‘Extreme means are allowable in extreme cases,’ was his
reply; ‘the father hath authority over his family, but if the
father be seized with madness, it is lawful for the children to
rise up against him, and, stripping him of his power, to place
him under constraint, for his safety and their own. So is it
with princes, madam; and that prince who goeth about in
his frenzy to commit iniquity, must be disarmed, deposed,
and cast into prison until he hath been brought to a more sober
mind, and disciplined to submission under the will of Heaven.’</p>

<p>It was a bold argument to propound in a royal palace in
the presence of majesty itself. The Queen looked at her
brother, astonished and aghast. True to his part, Moray
assumed an air of profound reflection and conviction after
mature thought. Again Mary felt goaded to irritation as she
wondered how Elizabeth would have brooked a similar discussion,
but she commanded herself with a strong effort, and
shifted her ground for a new attack.</p>

<p>‘And where shall we find this will of Heaven declared,’
argued the Queen, ‘or who shall decide between you and me
when each interprets differently the same command?’</p>

<p>‘The words of Scripture and the ordinances of the Church
are sufficient for our guidance,’ replied the preacher.</p>

<p>‘But <em>your</em> Church is not <em>mine</em>’, retorted the Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> ‘I
believe in my heart the Church of Rome to be the true Church
of God.’</p>

<p>‘Your <em>will</em>, madam,’ said the other, ‘cannot impose a <em>reason</em>,
neither doth opinion constitute argument; I am fully
prepared to bear witness against the Scarlet Woman whom
ye would fain substitute for the pure Spouse: but I will
employ the weapons of controversy, in which mine adversaries
are so skilled, to do battle for the right. I will undertake to
prove, against the strongest of your priestly disputants, that
the Romish Church hath more degenerated from the truth and
purity of apostolic teaching, than the Jews from the ordinances
handed down to them by their first lawgivers&mdash;Moses and
Aaron&mdash;when they shouted to the Roman governor that he
should crucify the innocent, and let Barabbas go free.’</p>

<p>‘My conscience tells me it is not so,’ answered Mary. ‘I
cannot contend with you in argument, as it is neither my profession
nor my pleasure; but I have read and studied and
formed my own conclusions. Why should not my views be
as clear as yours, or may we not both be right?’</p>

<p>‘Impossible!’ thundered Knox. ‘Ye shall come out from
the ungodly, and shall not be partakers with them&mdash;no, not
of one single drop in the cup of their abominations. There
is but one straight path for monarch and subject, the queen on
her throne and the beggar at the gate. I tell you, madam,
that if you deviate from it one hair’s-breadth, you shall be lost
in the howling wilderness, and become the prey of the raging
lion. I will not concede to you one jot nor one tittle; I will
prove to you that your tenets are false, your practice sinful,
and your ceremonials blasphemous. Stone by stone will I
destroy the edifice that priestly ambition hath raised on the
foundations of corruption, and cemented with the blood of the
prophets from time to time, even unto this day. First of all,
I will demolish the very keystone on which the whole fabric
rests; I will cast down the idol and trample it under my feet;
I will testify in the face of all men against the gross and godless
mummery of the mass.’</p>

<p>Mary looked shocked and a little scared at his vehemence;
she was irritated, too, by this unscrupulous attack on all she
held most sacred, but she controlled herself, and only replied,
quietly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Abuse is not argument, Master Knox; neither are assertions
of much weight until they are proved.’</p>

<p>He settled his gown on his shoulders, and spreading his
hands before him, proceeded to demonstrate his propositions
in the manner that had become habitual to him in the pulpit,
checking off the main points of his argument on his fingers as
he proceeded.</p>

<p>‘Ye maintain the mass,’ said he, ‘to be a sacrifice, and, as
such, to be holy in itself, for that things are sanctified which
have been once placed upon the altar! Ye argue that in the
Scriptures are to be found antitypes that shall support this
doctrine, and that Melchizedek, when he brought out bread
and wine before Abraham, prefigured the offering which ye
now esteem to be the holiest of mysteries. I will not pause
to discuss with one of your Majesty’s learning the object with
which Melchizedek brought forth these provisions, nor the
arguments which may be produced for and against the probability
that he simply offered them as refreshment to Abraham
and his company. We will let this be for the present, and
proceed at once to the very root and core of the matter. Ye
shall observe, madam, that of sacrifices, there are two kinds&mdash;the
sacrifices of propitiation, and the sacrifices of thanksgiving&mdash;the
<i>propitiatoriæ</i> and the <i>eucharistiæ</i>. Now, with regard
to the former,’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Hold, sir!’ interrupted the Queen, much to the divine’s
disappointment. ‘Now ye are launched on the depths of
controversial divinity, which are too profound for me, and ye
would fain confuse and overwhelm me with your learned Latin
terms; I pray your mercy. Under favour, I shall find those
who are better capable than I am of holding their ground in
argument against Master Knox.’</p>

<p>‘So be it, madam,’ answered the Reformer, proudly; ‘as
in the dark ages our ancestors feared not to encounter the
strongest champions armed with fleshly weapons in the lists,
so shall I be found, I humbly trust, prompt at the hour of
trial to do battle in the cause of truth.’</p>

<p>‘Those champions, at least, turned not their weapons against
a weak, helpless woman,’ replied Mary, in a tone of considerable
exasperation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> ‘When they opposed their sovereign, it
was to resist tyranny and oppression: not to deprive him of
his dignity, and even curtail him of his very amusements.
They fronted him boldly in the field, but they would have
scorned to wound him in his tenderest feelings, or to attack
him in the privacy of his household.’</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty’s shaft is well aimed,’ replied Knox; ‘yet
doth it rebound harmless from the armour of duty in which
the minister of the Word is encased. It is my calling, madam,
to reprove sin from the pulpit, whether it be found rearing its
head on high in the palace, or crawling among the sewers of
the street. I tell you, Mary Stuart, that the day will come
when your masques and your music and your mummeries shall
be recorded against you in such characters of fire as roused
Belshazzar and his nobles from their last revelry on earth.
In your feastings and fiddlings and dancings, do ye remember
the dance of death, down which ye are footing it so thoughtlessly?
When your ears are tickled by the foolish squeaking
of your lutes, your rebecks, or your virginals, do ye reflect on
the awful blast of the last trumpet, and the wail of perdition
coming up from the lake of fire?’</p>

<p>‘Then you esteem a simple, innocent measure to be an unpardonable
sin?’ retorted the Queen, in high scorn. ‘Master
Knox, Master Knox! is there not a certain virtue called
Charity, without which all the others are of no avail?’</p>

<p>‘The guilt of the action, madam,’ answered he, argumentatively,
‘depends on the motive of the dancer. David, indeed,
leaped and danced before the ark; but it was in pious zeal
and singleness of heart. Not so, that child of sin, the daughter
of Herodias, graceful and fierce-hearted as the panther,
when she danced off the head of John the Baptist. Think
ye, madam, that the walls of Holyrood will shelter the guilty
more securely than the roof of Antipas? Think ye that can
be but a harmless folly in the Queen of Scotland, which entailed
the curse of blood on that flaunting minion who so
charmed and cozened the Tetrarch of Galilee?’</p>

<p>‘And you dare compare me to her!’ exclaimed Mary, rising
from her chair with flashing eyes. ‘This is too much!
Moray! Brother! I appeal to you! This is too much!’</p>

<p>And turning away she covered her face with both hands
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Even Knox could not see her thus, unmoved. He hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to explain away all that was most offensive in his allusions.
As far as lay in his uncompromising nature, he strove to
modify the virulence of his declamation.</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam,’ said he, ‘to be effectual the remedies of the
physician must be unpalatable; but I mean not to offend
your Majesty, not to be guilty of any disrespect towards your
person. I would that you could see many matters in another
and a clearer light, for your own welfare and that of your
people. It is my zeal for your Majesty’s happiness here and
hereafter that makes me so stern and so unpleasant a counsellor.
I will fulfil my duty even at the risk of your Majesty’s
displeasure, and yet it grieves me in my human weakness to
see your fair face sad. It is my daily prayer that Mary Stuart
should be brought into the right path. I am an old man,
madam, if not in years, in labour and bodily infirmities. I am
no courtier, ye know right well. Believe me, I cherish no
disloyalty towards your person. I would fain see you a happy
triumphant monarch, the joy of your people, the hope and
stay of the godly, a fruitful branch in the vineyard, and a
second Deborah in Israel!’</p>

<p>The Queen was easily mollified. A bright smile dried the
tears on her face, and she stretched her hand graciously to
the zealous Reformer.</p>

<p>‘Ye shall advise with me from time to time, Master Knox,’
said she. ‘If I cannot compete with you in argument, I can
at least equal you in truth and sincerity, and a good-will to
that which is right.’</p>

<p>The churchman’s stern nature was moved. He bent over
the hand she gave him, and made as though he would have
touched it with his lips; then dropped it somewhat awkwardly,
and resumed with a little embarrassment.</p>

<p>‘I am at your Majesty’s service always, second only to His
whose minister I am. Yet I beseech you to dismiss me. I
may tarry no longer; even now I shall be blamed that I am
not at my book.’</p>

<p>‘Ye cannot be always at your book,’ replied the Queen,
smiling. ‘Doth not Solomon tell us, “there is a time for all
things?”’</p>

<p>‘Even so, madam,’ answered Knox, moving respectfully
towards the door;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> ‘yet must Time himself be seized by the
forelock, for his poll is bald behind. Master Buchanan would
not fail to remind your Majesty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Fronte capillatâ post est occasio calva.”’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen either imperfectly heard or did not perfectly
understand, for she bowed her farewell without replying; but
Moray, pondering on the adage, shook his head as he murmured
more to himself than to her&mdash;</p>

<p>‘There is a time even for seizing the time; and it is but an
indiscreet haste that would pluck the pear before it is ripe!’</p>

<p>As Knox traversed the ante-room in leaving the royal audience
chamber, he found the Maries sitting at work in that
apartment, and paused for an instant on his way through, to
contemplate that which was in truth a sufficiently pleasing
scene. The ladies were seated in different attitudes at their
embroidery, and although, doubtless, they had been in the full
tide of conversation previously, there was a profound silence
at the moment of his entrance.</p>

<p>Wistfully, nay sadly, with the concerned air of one who
looks on a bed of lilies that he foresees are to be withered at
night by the early frost, the preacher gazed for an instant on
this bevy of beauty ere he uncovered his head to salute them.
In doing so, his cap slipped out of his hand to the ground,
and it was curious to observe the behaviour of the Maries at
this juncture. It is needless to state that Master Knox
enjoyed but a small share of popularity amongst these ladies.
As the official reprover of all their gaieties and amusements,
it may easily be understood that they looked on him with no
approving eye, and that if they had one favourite aversion at
the court, next to a wet Valentine’s Day, it was Master John
Knox.</p>

<p>Though of active habits, the great Reformer was somewhat
stiff and enfeebled with rheumatism; he stooped with difficulty,
and for a while could not recover his lost head-gear.</p>

<p>Mistress Beton, sitting bolt upright, looked straight beyond
him at the opposite wall with the air of being as unconscious
of his presence as Mary Hamilton really was. The latter had
indeed been all the morning immersed in a brown study from
which it seemed impossible to extricate her. Mistress Carmichael
was not in the best of humours, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
observed that her fair brow had of late been continually
clouded, and her eyes full of tears, without apparent cause.
She made not the slightest movement of assistance in the old
man’s favour, and even whispered something to Mary Seton
with marked and offensive indifference; but the latter, springing
gaily from her chair, picked up the fallen skull-cap and
returned it to its owner with a pleasant smile, which, saucy
as it was, brightened her whole face, like a sunbeam.</p>

<p>‘I thank thee, fair mistress,’ said Knox. ‘These old limbs
of mine are stiff now, and the time is not far off when they
shall be motionless for evermore. Your knees are young and
supple; the more cause have you to be thankful and to bend
them while you can in prayer.’</p>

<p>‘The neck may be stiff as well as the knees,’ answered Mary
Seton, glancing meaningly towards the Queen’s chamber. ‘I
hope my loyalty may outlast my lissomeness, if I live to be as
old as your reverence!’</p>

<p>He smiled on her sorrowfully yet kindly.</p>

<p>‘The young,’ said he, ‘think that they are to live for ever,
and the old hope still to live a few years longer. Fair mistress,
fear God, do your duty, and snap your fingers at the chances
of life.’</p>

<p>Mistress Beton here interposed with stately scorn.</p>

<p>‘We shall scarce take lessons of Master Knox,’ said she,
‘in our duty towards the Queen. Under favour, sir, we need
none of your reverence’s teaching in loyalty and obedience.’</p>

<p>He turned good-humouredly towards her, still smiling.</p>

<p>‘Ye are angry with me, fair ladies,’ said he, ‘and why?
Because I am too old to learn your courtly graces, and too
honest to use your courtly terms? Because I call a fig a fig,
when I see one, and a spade a spade. Nay, ye should rather
prize and cherish one who can look even on <em>your</em> beauty without
his eyes being dazzled, and tell you the truth for your
salvation, rather than a lie for your ruin.’</p>

<p>‘Ye speak fairly,’ answered Mary Seton, who in virtue of
her previous civility seemed to have constituted herself in
some sort his protectress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> ‘Yet I warrant me ye spake not
so tenderly to her Majesty even now. I marvel that ye are
not abashed to look thus boldly in the face of an anointed
Queen!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, young lady,’ answered the preacher, in a tone of
pleasant humour, ‘why should the fair face of a gentlewoman
frighten me, who have fronted many angry men? Think ye
a bonny brow, unscored by guilt, can be an object of terror,
whether it be crowned with a circle of gold like hers, or a
wealth of bright hair like your own? No, no, the old man
can neither be coaxed nor frightened from doing his duty.’</p>

<p>The Maries looked from one to the other in uncertainty.
Knox had obviously gained their attention, and he added a few
words with a good motive.</p>

<p>‘I tell ye the truth, fair ladies,’ said he, preparing to withdraw.
‘Better take it from me than the truth-teller to whom
ye must listen some day, whether ye will or no. Ay! what
a goodly life were this if it could last for ever, or if we might
but pass to heaven with all this gay gear; but out upon the
knave death! that cometh whether we will or no, and strippeth
us of all, and taketh us we know not where! Prepare
yourselves for him now, fair ladies, while he is afar, so when
he cometh ye shall be found watching, and may laugh in
his face.’</p>

<p>His admonition was well meant and received with sufficient
decorum, but the impression soon faded away, for he had not
been gone five minutes ere they fell to discussing his outward
appearance, the severity of his manners, the fashion of his
garments, and the general unloveliness of his demeanour.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>John Knox went back to his studies and his labours. The
Queen and her Maries betook themselves to the duties of
adornment and the preparations for a journey. The court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was about to move for a season to the pleasant seaside town
of St Andrews, in Fife, a favourite resort with her Majesty,
and much affected by the household, as their sojourn in the
old episcopal city was marked by a gaiety and freedom from
restraint exceedingly welcome both to the sovereign and her
court. The cavalcade moved off in high spirits. It was but
a small party, consisting at the most of not more than twenty
equestrians, including the four maids-of-honour, and the more
immediate attendants on the person of royalty. Horses
stamped and snorted, and shook their bridles merrily, as they
were mounted at the palace gates to move on in gay procession
down the winding causeway that led towards the Firth.
Feathers waved, spurs jingled, men’s voices rose in merriment,
and the soft laughter of women floated like music on the pure
calm air. The dames of Queen Mary’s household, like their
mistress, were skilful horsewomen, yet it was wonderful how
many of those little attentions, which are so delightful to
render and so welcome to receive, they exacted from the cavaliers
who accompanied them. Horses were insufficiently
bitted, saddles insecurely girthed, housings unbecomingly disposed;
it seemed as if each of the fair travellers had reason to
complain of her groom’s negligence or incapacity, yet they
bore it with exemplary good humour notwithstanding. Even
Mary Carmichael, after refusing assistance from every gentleman
in turn, and bending her pretty fingers backward against
an obstinate buckle, was fain to apply to Walter Maxwell for
his help; and although it was rendered in the gravest and
coldest manner possible, thanked him with a bright and kindly
smile. It was, perhaps, the most provoking way to treat him.
Had she quarrelled with him outright, he would have known
how to act, for he was hurt and angered to the depths of his
loyal and resolute heart, but this off-hand good humour was
irritating in the extreme. It was treating him like a child,
he thought, and he chafed under it inwardly, the while the
girl herself was only striving to avoid a final rupture, and
longing to be friends with him as before.</p>

<p>‘Do you journey with us to St Andrews?’ said she,
glancing timidly at his immovable face; ‘or do you return to
Holyrood from the waterside?’ and her heart beat faster
while she waited for his answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>‘As the Queen shall direct,’ he replied, it must be admitted,
not with his natural sincerity. ‘I confess I am profoundly
indifferent myself.’ He spoke in a hard, dry tone, and she
made her horse bound forward from his side, and bent her
head down to caress the animal, till her bright hair mingled
with its mane.</p>

<p>The others rode gaily on, talking and laughing joyfully, all
but the Queen. Mary Stuart was a thought paler than her
wont, and unusually silent and preoccupied. Was it that her
remonstrances of Master Knox had sunk into her heart? or
was she overladen with the cares of her kingdom? or was
there some feeling of pity and compunction gnawing her,
foreign to the weightier considerations of religion and policy,
yet, perhaps, keener and more engrossing than these? Whatever
might be the reason, she, who was generally so eager, so
buoyant, on an expedition like this, now rode listlessly and
carelessly with her hand resting idly on her knee, and her
rein lying loosely on her horse’s neck. ‘Black Agnes,’ however,
by no means shared the dejection of her mistress. That
favourite palfrey, a gift from her brother Moray, and called
after the famous Agnes of Dunbar, who was Countess of
Moray in her own right, was in the highest spirits at her
release from the stable, and, sharing the mettle of the tameless
heroine whose name she bore, was no eligible conveyance
for an inattentive horsewoman. Ere the gleaming waters of
the Firth were in sight, the black mare shied at a beggar on
the road-side, and swerved from him with such activity, that
Mary, unprepared as she was, must have been unseated had a
dexterous hand not seized her bridle-rein at the decisive
moment, and a ready arm supported her till she regained her
balance in the saddle.</p>

<p>‘It is the last service I may render my Queen,’ said
Chastelâr’s low, sad voice in her ear. ‘O madam, send me
not away from you, I beseech you!’</p>

<p>She knew he was in the cavalcade, indeed she had never
retracted the permission originally given, that he should
accompany the court to St Andrews, and perhaps something
had told her he was not riding very far off, although she had
resolved to treat him henceforth with enforced coldness and
reserve. As she turned to thank him now, and marked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
gallant bearing, the skill with which he rode his mettled
chestnut horse, the bravery of his apparel, the respectful
deference of his manner, and the pale worn face that told of
so much sorrow and suffering, the Queen’s heart swelled with
that remorseful pity which is not many degrees removed from
a softer feeling.</p>

<p>‘You must leave me now,’ she said, hurriedly. ‘I will
tell you more when we are embarked. You shall come to me
then for your last directions, Chastelâr, and to bid me
farewell!’</p>

<p>‘Is there no hope?’ he asked, in a low stifled whisper.</p>

<p>‘None,’ she answered, firmly, in the same guarded tone.
‘O Chastelâr! I pity you,’ she added, while the tears sprang
to her eyes; ‘from my heart I pity you; but it <em>must</em> be so.’</p>

<p>He fell back quietly and humbly. Mary put ‘Black
Agnes’ into a gallop, and the cavalcade were soon engaged in
all the bustle of embarkation at the waterside.</p>

<p>It was Valentine’s Day, and the weather was indeed in
unison with that mild and popular saint. It was one of
those soft pleasant days, with a calm atmosphere and a serene
though clouded sky, that come in the early spring to remind
us of the principles of growth and fragrance still existing,
though dormant, in the bosom of the teeming earth. The
russet sward was saturated with moisture, and not a bud had
yet started into life, not a snowdrop lifted its gentle head on
the southern side of the sleeping braes and shaws, heavy
with the promise of another year. Ashore, the rooks were
flocking to the fresh-turned glebe, where the bright ploughshare,
sticking in the furrow, marked that the half-day’s work
was done; while, on the broad Firth, soft and smooth and
white as milk, the dark sea-bird rode calm and motionless, as
if at anchor, poised on the surface of his home; the distant
mountains loomed grand and dim and sullen, the nearer
points and promontories shot sharply out into the water,
clearly defined against the sheeted level of the Firth; the
very tide seemed but to heave and sob at intervals, lapping
drowsily against the dripping sea-weed on the rocks. It was
a scene of beauty, but beauty of a softening, saddening tendency,
and all on board were fain to acknowledge its melancholy
influence and partake in the depression it produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The sturdy boatmen bent to their oars; the courtiers,
disposed in different attitudes, appeared chiefly intent on
arriving at the termination of their voyage; and Mary, sitting
in the stern of the boat, dipped her hand idly in the water,
silent and gazing downwards, in obvious disquietude of
mind.</p>

<p>Chastelâr watched the Queen with eager eyes. After a
while he struck a few notes on the lute, without which he
seldom travelled; and observing that this, as usual, was the
signal for general attention, and that Mary did not seem to
disapprove, proceeded to play a mournful melody, which, as
it rose and fell, he accompanied in apparent abstraction with
his voice.</p>

<p>As he concluded, even the rough boatmen looked from one
to the other in undisguised approval. Never insensible to
the charms of music have been these bold sons of the sea.
To this day they are persuaded that the silver shoals of
herring are attracted by harmonious sounds, and they dredge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for oysters with a low monotonous chant, that they believe
peculiarly grateful to that retiring zoophyte. Long after
Chastelâr’s last notes had died gradually out over the silent
waters, they laid to their oars with a will, and seemed to pull
their long sweeping strokes in measured cadence to the unforgotten
strain. The Maries, too, applauded enthusiastically,
all but one, and she was weeping in silence, because her heart
was full.</p>

<p>In the stern of the boat, a wide roomy shallop, pulled by
some six or eight oars, the Queen sat apart from the rest of
the company. More than once she had glanced at Chastelâr
while he sung, and varying expressions, none of them in
keeping with the serene sky overhead, had crossed her brow.
After he had finished, she remained silent for several minutes,
absorbed in deep reflection. By degrees, as they approached
the opposite shore of Burntisland, and the hills of Fife began
to rise clear and brown above the black, jagged rocks and
level strips of white sand that edged the water’s margin, the
attention of Her Majesty’s train became diverted to the
different objects around, and anon a shoal of porpoises,
tumbling to windward in grotesque succession, drew them,
with many exclamations of wonder and amusement, to the
bows.</p>

<p>None were now left in the stern of the boat save the
Queen and the steersman. That ancient Triton’s whole
attention was riveted, seaman-like, on the shallows they were
nearing, where, for the first time during their passage, the
rolling waves were breaking languidly into surf. Chastelâr
remained in the place he had never quitted, his eyes fixed on
the Queen’s face. She beckoned him to approach, and in an
instant he was at her side.</p>

<p>‘We remain at Burntisland to-night,’ said Mary, in a low
measured voice that seemed the result either of extreme
indifference or perfect self-command. ‘In the morning we
shall ride on to St Andrews. I have a packet that must be
delivered without delay at Dunfermline. Can I depend
upon you to undertake its safe arrival there before to-morrow’s
dawn?’</p>

<p>He assented eagerly. This was no such distant banishment!
He should be under the same sky, within a da<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>y’s
journey! The light of hope shone over his face, but while the
Queen proceeded in those dry, chilling tones, it faded as it
came.</p>

<p>‘You will ride thence to Stirling, where you will remain
until you receive instructions from Maitland or Melvil. They
will be accompanied by letters for the French Court, and on
the instant of their receipt you will depart for Paris. Chastelâr,
I depend upon your obedience&mdash;you will not fail me.’</p>

<p>The cold drops stood on his forehead. It was in a broken,
hollow voice that he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘My life is in your hands. Do with me what you will!’</p>

<p>Again her kindly heart smote her sore. It was a fearful
gift this charm that she possessed. It was a dreadful
responsibility thus to hold the happiness of a human being,
so to speak, in her hand. Could she dash it to pieces without
some tinge of pity and remorse? She resumed her task very
sadly and unwillingly.</p>

<p>‘It is better,’ said she, ‘that this should be done at once.
Queen though she be, nay, <em>because</em> she is a Queen, Mary
Stuart may not listen for a moment to the voice of her own
feelings, nor the impulse of her own heart, pitying as it does
those who are in trouble, though their sufferings and their
sorrows spring from their own deed. Nay,’ she added, seeing
him about to speak, and deprecating his words, as it were,
with a gentle, almost a caressing gesture of her white hand,
‘there is nothing you can urge that shall induce me to alter
my determination. A woman’s heart is weak, but her <em>will</em> is
iron as a man’s. It <em>must</em> be so, Chastelâr, for your own sake&mdash;and&mdash;and
for mine!’</p>

<p>‘O God!’ he exclaimed, in an agony like a man writhing
under a death-blow. ‘Have pity&mdash;have pity! Anything
but this&mdash;any disgrace, any punishment, any ordeal. But
oh! think of the forlorn, despairing prayer, “Entreat me not
to leave thee!”’</p>

<p>The tears dropped fast from her eyes, and the beautiful
face quivered in its struggle to be firm. What was that to
him? He could only think her hard, unfeeling as the seaboard
rock. She yielded not an inch.</p>

<p>‘It <em>must</em> be so,’ she repeated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> ‘loyal and true, you will not
fail me at last!’</p>

<p>His eyes flashed with anger. Man’s nature can scarce endure
great sorrow without a tinge of resentment.</p>

<p>‘Loyalty and truth are soon forgotten in the absent,’
said he, bitterly. ‘Lip-service and flattery are more welcome
to princes. I cannot refuse to make room for a newer
favourite!’</p>

<p>She smiled on him gentle and forgiving through her tears.</p>

<p>‘You are unjust,’ she said, ‘and unkind; you know it is
not so; and when you are far off it will be your punishment
to think that you could have spoken such words to me
to-day.’</p>

<p>The reaction of his feelings was frightful: he put his hand
to his throat as if he was choking, and gasped out in broken
syllables&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Forgive me! only forgive me before I go out from the
light into eternal darkness and despair!’</p>

<p>‘Obedience?’ she asked in her turn, looking wistfully at
the shore, which they were now approaching; and on their
arrival at which, something perhaps warned her that she must
take her last leave of Chastelâr and his unselfish, unexacting
devotion.</p>

<p>‘To the death!’ he replied; and even while he spoke the
boatmen shipped their oars, and those who were forward
leaped out waist-deep in water, to steady the shallop for the
disembarkation of the ladies.</p>

<p>This was no such easy task. In these days people walk
from a roomy steamer roofed in and glazed like a conservatory,
across a platform securely railed on to a substantial
stone-built quay that reaches a quarter of a mile out into the
Firth, and renders them as independent of tide as the vessel
herself does of weather; save for the slight oscillation caused
by the motive power, a blind man, unless in a gale of wind,
would never know that he had left <i>terra firma</i>. But even
within the recollection of those now scarce past middle age,
the crossing of the Firth was an affair of considerable discomfort,
if not a little danger. The state of the tide was of
paramount importance; the transit in an open boat, generally
of the smallest and craziest description, to the steamer moored
half-a-mile off, was in itself a voyage of no slight apprehension
to the timid, especially if the wind had been blowing for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
or three days steadily from the east: and the disembarkation
on the northern side was, if possible, worse; the boat had to
be beached with practised dexterity not to capsize altogether,
and under the most favourable circumstances the pursuing
waves were pretty sure to come dashing in over her stern,
wetting to the skin those unwary passengers who had not
taken refuge at the prow.</p>

<p>At low water also a considerable journey had to be made
which partook of the discomforts both of land and sea, inasmuch
as it was performed in the ungainly fashion termed by
schoolboys ‘pick-a-back,’ on the shoulders of veteran boatmen
wading knee-deep through the surf. To a heavy weight and
a timid rider this mode of progression was also not without
its terrors, for if the bearer, generally old and often infirm,
made the slightest false step, a very complete ducking was the
inevitable result.</p>

<p>In this hazardous mode it was necessary to land the Queen
and her ladies on their arrival at Burntisland: the scene was
one of bustle, dash, and excitement, none the less picturesque
for the hard-weather appearance of the boatmen and the gaudy
dresses of the fishermen’s wives and daughters, who came down
in numbers to welcome their Sovereign, and shrank not from
criticising in loud ear-piercing tones the personal appearance
of the party, and the whole details of the proceeding.</p>

<p>The horses that had been conveyed across in the boat accompanying
the Queen’s, splashed one after another into the
water, amidst shouts of laughter, and half-swam, half-scrambled
ashore as they might. The retainers and men-at-arms jeered
each other merrily as they waded through the waves, or wrung
the wet from their boots and clothing on the sand; the female
spectators screamed out their advice and opinions, fluttering
aloof shrill and pertinacious as the sea-mews themselves;
whilst white-headed urchins ran hither and thither through
the crowd, devising impossible jobs which they professed
their readiness to perform for the smallest remuneration in
copper. But the Queen’s shallop excited the interest and
attention of all.</p>

<p>One by one the ladies were received into the arms of their
attending boatmen, to be conveyed tenderly and carefully
ashore. In right of his years, his experience, his patriarchal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
dignity, and his solemn demeanour, the oldest of these boatmen
was entrusted with the person of the Queen. He was a
stalwart, fine old man, broad in the shoulders, deep in the
chest, large of stature, and strong of limb. He took Mary in
his arms as if she had been a baby, and waded with her
deliberately through the surf; another score of yards, and
she would have been safe on land; but whether the veteran
had been celebrating his prospective distinction by deep potations
of alcohol, or whether his toil-worn frame failed him at
the pinch, or whether it was indeed by one of those fatalities
for which it is impossible to account, he made a false step, a
fruitless effort to recover it, and but for prompt assistance must
have precipitated his royal burden before him into the water.</p>

<p>Need we say that it was Chastelâr who was at hand to
save; that it was his grasp which plucked the Queen from
her falling supporter at this critical juncture; and that for a
few blissful moments, worth to his delirious fancy whole ages
of torture, the love-stricken poet for the first and last time
bore the precious form of Mary Stuart in his arms?</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, gently, he waded with her to the land;
not a word was spoken&mdash;not a look exchanged; the Queen’s
face was cold and impassive as marble, and Chastelâr, in the
tumult of his love and his despair, was conscious but of one
frantic wish, that the waves would rise over their heads and
cover them, and they might be at rest fathom-deep down there
together for evermore.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The episode of idolatry and madness was fast drawing to
a close. When the Queen and her household went to
establish themselves in the lodging where they designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
pass the night, Chastelâr remained on the beach, apparently
unconscious of all about him, gazing out to seaward, as a man
does who is utterly lost to the interests and occupations of the
shore. Amongst the many mysterious sympathies that connect
natural objects so inexplicably with the mind, there is a
strange affinity between human sorrow and the watery element&mdash;be
it the gentle ripple of a running stream, or the dash and
recoil of the mounting wave breaking on the beach, or the
dark-blue line of a sea-horizon clear against the sky.</p>

<p>There is some morbid attraction to mortal grief in the contemplation
of each of these; there is something that takes
man out of himself, and though it speaks not of hope or
consolation, seems to promise oblivion and repose at last.
Ay, we love to prate of the beauties of nature, to enlarge
upon the pleasures of smiling skies and gorgeous landscapes
and magnificent scenery. Are we quite honest about the
effect produced by such objects? and can we declare that
they create sensations of unmixed gratification? On the contrary,
most of us, if sincere, will confess that when we were
happy, we took very little notice of them; and it was but in
some keen, hopeless sorrow we turned to nature for an anodyne,
and found she added sharpness to our pangs and mocked
us with a smile as she poured fresh venom into the wound.
No; if we would be consoled, we must look to where the
running stream loses itself in the ocean that we have never
seen; we must carry our thoughts athwart the far horizon in
search of the eternal shore; we must strain our eyes to pierce
the smiling heaven, and catch if but a glimpse of the undying
world beyond.</p>

<p>Chastelâr paced to and fro upon the sand with all the worst
passions of our nature tearing at a heart that yet seemed
formed for better things. Utterly undisciplined in his wild,
imaginative character, he had never prepared himself for such
complete desolation as this. For many years, more than he
now dared count, the smiles of that beautiful Queen had been
to him dearer than the very air he breathed. A less enthusiastic
temperament would have asked itself long ago to what
result this abject service, this blind adoration, could eventually
lead, and would, at least, have prepared for the final
shock, which it required little sagacity to foresee must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sooner or later tumble the magic edifice to the ground; but
Chastelâr’s was a character that never stops to count the cost.</p>

<p>There was to him an unspeakable joy in the very abandonment
of his attachment, in the lavish devotion which only
asked to be received without return. Full of a generous fire
kindled in his own ardent imagination, and nourished by
those seductive follies which constituted the very essence of
an age of chivalry, it seemed to him as rich a happiness to
cherish his hopeless attachment for the Queen, as it would
have seemed to a coarser and stronger mind to possess itself
of Mary’s heart and person. The poet never dreamed the
time could come when he should be told that even this self-sacrifice
was unwelcome; that for one unguarded word, wrung
from him by the very depth and tenderness of his feelings, he
should be banished from her presence, and that she who was
the light of his eyes should herself determine that he must
look upon her no more.</p>

<p>Presently the devil got into his heart; the rebellious spirit,
that is never so strong as when men feel they have been virtuous
and self-denying in vain, rose tumultuous now, all the
fiercer for having been kept down so long, and urged the
counsels of despair. Of what availed his old and faithful
service, his constancy, his loyalty, his obedience, and truth?
She flung them away as nothing, and less than nothing; she
could take his warm fresh heart from him when it suited her,
as a mere matter of pastime, and squeezing it, as one would
squeeze an orange, give it him back again when she had no
further use for it, all withered and empty, the very essence of
its existence gone.</p>

<p>Queen though she were, she had no right to do this. She
forbade him her presence! He would see her whether she
would or no! He had done with obedience now, and discretion
and consideration! He would speak to Mary Stuart
once more, if all the devils in hell rose to prevent it!</p>

<p>Turning on his steps he strode fiercely along the now
solitary shore in the direction of the hamlet of Burntisland,
where the Queen was to pass the night. Already the day
was waning, and the evening mist, gathering from the eastward,
crept slowly up the margin of the Firth. A light
drizzling rain had also begun to fall, and the sea-gulls, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
longer floating in repose, were screaming and turning restlessly
on the wing, as they flitted to and fro in search of
shelter for the night. Boatmen and fishwives had betaken
themselves to their homes, and none were left to witness the
gestures of anger and despair with which the unhappy
Chastelâr accompanied his racking, maddening thoughts.
He wrapped his cloak round him, and walked faster and
faster as he began to shape his resolve.</p>

<p>But within a short distance of the hamlet he met a figure
approaching him through the increasing gloom: a female
figure cloaked and hooded, walking swiftly, yet with smooth,
majestic gait, and of a stature that seemed unusually lofty in
that uncertain light. For an instant the blood gathered round
his heart as a possibility flashed across him that even in his
madness he could scarcely dare believe. In that space of
time a thousand frantic surmises swept through his brain.
Reaction, remorse, a woman’s pity, and a woman’s tenderness,
overriding all, even the reserve and dignity of a Queen. But
the foolish fancies died out rapidly as they arose, for the
figure stopped, handed him in silence a small packet tied round
with a morsel of silk (he could notice such a trifle even then),
and while she threw back her hood with a gesture of relief,
the clear, guileless eyes of Mary Hamilton looked him sadly
and inquiringly in the face.</p>

<p>She spoke not for a while; she seemed to stop and take
breath; then she said, very quietly and coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The Queen bade me bring you this. She says it must be
forwarded without delay.’</p>

<p>He bowed courteously. He had recovered himself now, for
he had a scheme in view, and shaping it out rapidly in his
working brain, he bethought him that here was an unconscious
instrument which he might turn to good account.</p>

<p>‘How did you know where to find me?’ he asked, forcing
himself to smile.</p>

<p>A bright blush swept over the maid-of-honour’s forehead,
but she paled again almost immediately as she replied&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>‘I saw you from our window walking on the shore. I
knew it was you, and I asked to bring the packet myself because
they tell me you are going away to-night, and I was
anxious to bid you farewell.’</p>

<p>This was a great deal for Mary Hamilton to say. No successful
gallant could have wrung such an avowal from her
lips; but the keen eye of affection had told her that Chastelâr
was dejected and unhappy; so she longed to console him and
speak kindly to him ere he went away.</p>

<p>Should he not have pitied her? He who knew what it
was to love in vain? Of all women on earth he should have
spared <em>her</em>; but the devil had entered into him and he saw
in this pure, unselfish affection a way to his own object; so
she, too, must be sacrificed without remorse. What did it
matter? Was <em>he</em> alone to suffer and be trampled under foot?</p>

<p>‘It was good of you, Mistress Hamilton,’ he replied, with a
soft glance from his dark eyes, that made her flush and
tremble where she stood. ‘Few but yourself would have
been so considerate, and I should have valued the kindness as
much from <em>none</em>. Shall I leave <em>one</em> person at Court to regret
me when I am gone?’</p>

<p>‘More than that,’ she answered, hurriedly, and scarce knowing
what she said, ‘there will be no music for us now, at least
none worth listening to. The Queen said so herself&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;are
you not coming back again?’</p>

<p>‘Never!’ he replied, darkly; and then, seeing her scared
and troubled face, adding, with a laugh, ‘Never is a long
word, is it not? and who can tell in such a country as this
what a few months may bring? But I shall be absent a
weary while, Mistress Hamilton, and I cannot bear unkindness
from those I love. I would not willingly be forgotten and
supplanted by newer faces.’</p>

<p>Her eloquent eyes told him <em>that</em> was impossible, but she
dared not trust herself to speak.</p>

<p>‘Will you think of me when I am gone?’ he proceeded, in
a lower tone, and pressing nearer his companion’s side.
‘When you are feasting merrily at Holyrood, and enjoying
dance and song and revelry, will you not keep one little corner
in your heart for the absent who used to do all in his poor
power to make your time pass pleasantly, who will be thinking
every hour so sadly and longingly of you?’</p>

<p>Even in the midst of her astonished happiness she experienced
a shadowy misgiving that it was too good to be real;
but she could only reply&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You must think very poorly of us all, Chastelâr, if you
imagine we could ever forget you.’</p>

<p>‘It is not distance that can separate those who care for
each other,’ resumed the poet, dreamily; ‘after all, it is
thought that unites soul to soul; that sea-bird’s wing would
droop ere he had traversed a thousand miles of ocean, and yet
twice the distance separates the lover from his mistress no
more than a score of yards and a brick wall. He can be with
her in spirit, although his body may be at the uttermost end
of the earth. Nevertheless, for all this, Mistress Hamilton,
it grieves me sore to bid you farewell.’</p>

<p>She could have listened to him for an hour; she loved to
hang on his musical accents, and drink in the tones of his
rich, southern voice; above all, were such sentiments as these
congenial to her own lofty conceptions of an ideal, and her
trusting, clinging heart.</p>

<p>He was pitiless; he went on speaking low and hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘We may not meet again for many, many months&mdash;perhaps
never in this world. Do you think I am a man of marble
that I cannot feel? Do you think <em>mine</em> is a happy lot, thus
to leave all I value or esteem and take not even hope with me
into exile? Mary Hamilton, you will not refuse me what I
ask you on such a day as this?’</p>

<p>‘I would give my life for yours,’ she answered, scarce above
her breath. ‘What is it you would have me do?’</p>

<p>‘Listen,’ he replied. ‘I must be in the saddle soon after
nightfall. For reasons I cannot explain to you, it must be
supposed by the household that I have departed at sun-down.
My very life is in danger, if I am known to have remained.
I cannot tell you why. Do you trust me?’</p>

<p>She bowed her head.</p>

<p>‘I trust you,’ she answered, very quietly, and he needed
only to look in her face for confirmation of her words.</p>

<p>‘Then grant me my request,’ he resumed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> ‘It is a foolish
fancy of mine, but <em>you</em> at least cannot blame, though you may
scoff at it. There is one person whom I must see the very
last before I depart. One face of which I must take the
picture with me, into banishment, engraven on my heart, one
hand of which the farewell pressure must remain on mine till
we meet again. An hour after supper I will be at the door
of the small garden into which your apartments open. You
will meet me there for the last, <em>last</em> time?’</p>

<p>She looked a good deal frightened and discomposed.</p>

<p>‘But I shall not be dismissed so soon,’ she urged, ‘and if
I am absent they will come to look for me everywhere, and
oh! I ought not! I ought not!’</p>

<p>He was prepared for her objection&mdash;he knew the Queen’s
habit so well&mdash;this was exactly what he wanted.</p>

<p>‘Nay, then,’ he resumed, ‘I will ask you to risk nothing
for my sake; and yet, see the last of the dear face, I must
and will. The days are short now. It is already twilight,
and it will be as dark as midnight in an hour. I will go
make my preparations for departure. Do you, as you enter,
unlock the garden-door and take the key with you; it cannot
then be fastened from the inside. I will conceal myself
amongst the shrubs and wait for you there. As soon as you
are dismissed for the night you can come out and bid me
farewell.’</p>

<p>‘It is better not,’ she murmured, in sad perturbation. She
could not bear to refuse him, and yet all her womanly feelings
revolted at the clandestine nature of such a proceeding.
‘We are close at home now. All good attend you, Chastelâr.
I will pray for you night and morning&mdash;farewell!’</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, as if to take her final leave, but
she had not the heart to withdraw it at once. It lingered
long and lovingly in his clasp.</p>

<p>‘Mary!’ said he, and the dear name came so tenderly off
his lips. ‘Mary! you will not let me part from you thus?’</p>

<p>‘I will do as you wish,’ was all she answered, once more
dropping the hood over her face and hurrying away. They
were within a stone’s throw of the Queen’s lodging, and it was
already time for her to resume her duties. Her mind was in
a sad tumult when she left him. She felt she was going to do
wrong, deliberately wrong; yet how could she refuse him?
She loved him so, and he was going away!</p>

<p>With a wicked smile, suggestive of anything but mirth or
happiness, engraven, as it were, on his countenance, Chastelâr
strode up the narrow street to the stable in which his trusty
chestnut was disposed. This animal was a gift from the
Queen, and valued accordingly. We would fain describe him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
from his velvet muzzle to his flinty hoofs, for where shall we
find so seductive a theme as the beauty of a horse? but will
only observe that he was in every respect a fitting present from
royalty. The Frenchman ordered his favourite to be saddled
with considerable parade, and spoke loudly of the journey
before him. Then, ostentatiously assuming his arms and
valise, mounted and rode away in the direction of Dunfermline,
followed, as his figure disappeared in the gloom, by the
admiring glances of such ostlers and retainers as his noisy
departure had gathered to observe him.</p>

<p>For a mile or so he proceeded along the coast, and then,
turning off the horse-track into the recess of an old quarry,
dismounted and fastened his horse to the roots of a whin-bush,
growing from the chinks in the cold blue stone. For all his
feverish excitement, he disposed the animal in a nook sheltered
from the chill east wind, and taking his own cloak from
about him cast it over the flanks of his dumb friend. Then,
with a farewell pat, he returned on foot the way he had come,
rapidly and breathlessly, never stopping till he reached the
hamlet of Burntisland, and saw the lights twinkling once
more in the Queen’s lodging.</p>

<p>He stole softly to the garden-gate, of which he had spoken
to Mary Hamilton. It opened noiselessly to his push. By
this time it was quite dark, and on entering the enclosure he
found no necessity for concealment amongst the scanty shrubs
it contained. Here he drew off his heavy horseman’s boots
with extreme caution, and thus, with his rapier at his side,
and his pistols in his belt, took up his position close against
the door of the house, which opened outwards.</p>

<p>Here he waited, watched, and listened. A drizzling rain
was falling, and the wind was very keen, but, though stripped
to his doublet and hose, Chastelâr was unconscious of the
weather. Had he been immersed in snow, he could scarce
have felt cold while that fever burned and raged so fiercely at
his heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘For constancy hath her place above,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And life is thorny, and youth is vain,</div>
<div class="verse">And to be wroth with one we love,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Doth work like madness in the brain.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen’s supper and the <i>couchée</i> which succeeded it
seemed endless. Her Majesty, though by no means in
her usual spirits, eating but little, and scarcely speaking at all,
was yet none the more disposed to dismiss her ladies and
betake herself to repose. Mary Hamilton, with flushed cheeks
and unsettled gestures, busied herself about every arrangement
she could think of that should further the process of retiring
for the night, till even the Queen, rousing from her meditations,
taxed her with being fatigued after her ride, and did
not scruple to hint at the remarkable restlessness of her
demeanour. After this she controlled herself, indeed, with
an effort; but felt the while, that if the suspense continued
much longer it would drive her mad.</p>

<p>It was Mary Seton’s turn and hers to put the Queen to bed;
and the gossiping propensities of the former, whose lively disposition
never acknowledged fatigue or low spirits, did by no
means conduce to the despatch of matters. For reasons of
her own, too, this young lady chose to ask a series of questions
concerning the Earl of Bothwell, and the probability of
his returning to Court, interspersed with remarks on that
nobleman and his borderers and his enemies&mdash;all delivered
with considerable freedom and a flippancy peculiar to herself.
The Queen, who seemed to-night more or less impatient of
every subject broached, at length called her a ‘saucy chatterbox,’
and bade her good-humouredly ‘hold her tongue.’ As
usual, the reproof only produced a merry smile and a provoking
little grimace, at which Her Majesty could not forbear
laughing, though she looked sadder than ever a moment afterwards.</p>

<p>Wearily the minutes passed on. Mary Hamilton had never
before thought royalty so exacting, or an attendance on her
own dear mistress so tiresome. One by one the Queen’s garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
had to be taken off, folded up and disposed, each in its
proper place; then the loose flowing gown was brought her
by the senior maid-of-honour, and the junior let down the
long, rich hair that covered her more nobly than the mantle
of royalty itself. While Mistress Seton combed and stroked
those chestnut tresses carefully, Mistress Hamilton brought a
basin and ewer, offering it on her knees; after which ceremony,
it was her duty to place an ivory crucifix, and a small
lamp, with the Queen’s breviary, on the table by her bed-side;
then she handed Her Majesty’s beautiful rosary, consisting of
beads of sandal-wood, inlaid with silver, and Mary Stuart betook
her, after the manner of the ancient faith, to those devotions
she never neglected in her chequered life, and that served
her so nobly in the hour of trial with which it closed.</p>

<p>The maids-of-honour retired. Mary Seton would fain have
prolonged the conversation, even on the threshold of their
mutual chamber. She was never tired, not she! but her
friend, vowing she had forgotten something in the supper-room,
hurried away down-stairs, with a feeling of intense
relief, and yet horribly frightened and uncomfortable, as
she fled like a lapwing along the dark passages towards the
garden.</p>

<p>The servants and retainers had all gone to their repose,
wearied with the toils of the day, and anticipating an early
start on the morrow. Even in that small house there was
something gloomy and alarming in the profound silence.
Mary Hamilton, while conscious of the purity of her motives,
trembled, as innocence always does tremble, far more violently
than guilt; and it was with a beating heart and quick-coming
breath that she reached the door, and, unfastening it gently,
peered out into the thick darkness beyond.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she waited, listening anxiously. Not
a sound was to be heard but the dull beat of the tide upon
the shore. Then she advanced a few paces into the garden,
now that it seemed likely to elude her, more resolved upon
the interview than she could have believed possible a short
while ago. The small rain struck chill against her face,
and she strained her eyes in vain to pierce the surrounding
gloom.</p>

<p>Had she turned round at this moment, she might perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
have faintly distinguished a dark shadow that passed swiftly
from behind the door, and entered the house by the passage
she had just quitted.</p>

<p>But she was intent only on Chastelâr. She stepped softly
to the garden door, and peeped into the sandy lane on which
it opened. Here there was a little more light, and she could
see some ten or a dozen paces to right and left. No living
object was discernible; the rain fell faster, and the tide moaned
and gurgled in its ebb and flow against the shallow beach.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton was puzzled and distressed. An hour ago
she would have hailed as an unspeakable relief the news that
Chastelâr had actually gone without further parley, but now
that she had been schooling herself and stringing her nerves
for an interview, it was provoking that so much agitation
should be wasted for nothing; it seemed hard and cruel not
to see him just once again.</p>

<p>She ventured on a gentle cough; a timid whisper, very soft
and cautious; there was no result. At last she spoke his
name out loud, and then, half-frightened and a good deal disappointed,
made her way back into the house, barring the
door after her with as little noise as her trembling hands
would permit.</p>

<p>Poor Mary Hamilton! In that dark passage she paused to
lay her head against the wall and weep. She dared not return
at once to the chamber which she shared with her comrades,
in case any one of them should be awake. She felt she
could not brook observation or remark on her streaming eyes
and agitated looks. As the tears flowed silently, they did her
so much good! For weeks the girl had been living in a
morbid state of overstrung excitement. Continually in the
presence of the man she loved, and that man gifted with many
brilliant qualities exceedingly attractive to the female heart;
never convinced of his preference, yet suspecting it from a
thousand trifles that she naturally interpreted in her own
favour; living in an atmosphere of alternate hope and fear,
exposed to the daily charm of his person, his conversation,
his musical talents, and his warm foreign cordiality, it was no
wonder that she hailed as a blissful relief the certainty which
she was persuaded had burst upon her to-day, even though
accompanied by the miserable conviction that she must bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
him a long, perhaps a hopeless farewell. The sweet and the
bitter were strangely mingled in the cup she had drained so
eagerly&mdash;the cup that slakes, but never quenches thirst. She
was so relieved, and yet so troubled; so proud, and yet so
fearful; so happy, yet so sad.</p>

<p>What could a poor woman do but droop her head and weep
her heart out, simply because she <em>was</em> a woman?</p>

<p>Suddenly she started as if she had been shot. A loud
shriek, followed by a succession of outcries for assistance in
the Queen’s voice, rang through the small house, and were
quickly followed by the scuffling of feet, the banging of doors,
and the tumult of many tongues, in which the shrill tones
of the maids-of-honour predominated. Lights were already
glancing in the passages; women in white, with pale, scared
faces, and half-dressed men but half-awake, snatching at whatever
weapons came to hand, rushed to and fro tumultuously;
everybody seemed exceedingly alarmed and excited, but none to
know the least what was the matter. All this Mary Hamilton
observed as we see things in a dream, while she rushed up-stairs,
and dashed unhesitatingly into the Queen’s chamber.</p>

<p>The sight that met her there arrested her as if by magic
on the threshold. In the twinkling of an eye, the warm impulsive
woman seemed frozen into a statue.</p>

<p>Pale as her night gear, breathless and trembling, while she
clung to her brother’s shoulder for support, yet with the
‘Stuart frown’ stamped sternly on her brow, the Queen was
gazing in fear and anger on the dark figure of a man who
stood with his arms folded, in the corner of the apartment.
That man, calm, erect, defiant, almost sublime in the intrepidity
with which he confronted threatening brows and levelled
weapons (for already the royal retainers were filling the place),
was Chastelâr. Mary Hamilton turned sick and giddy while
she looked. The Queen raved and shook, and seemed half-mad
with fear and shame; her ladies crowded about her in
helpless astonishment and dismay, while the servants and
men-at-arms glanced from one to another, utterly at their
wit’s end. Except the fatal cause himself of all this disturbance,
Moray alone seemed to retain his presence of mind.
Alternately, he soothed his frantic sister, and gave directions
to the astonished bystanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Stab him!’ exclaimed the Queen, pointing with shaking
hand at the unfortunate man who stood there, so pale, so
calm, offering no attempt at escape or resistance. ‘Brother,
for the honour of our house, put your sword through him, an’
ye be half a Stuart. Let him not live an hour to boast of
this daring, this atrocious insult. Oh, it is too much&mdash;too
much!’</p>

<p>The Queen covered her face with both hands, completely
overcome; her beautiful hair, escaping from the ribbon which
confined it, fell over her shoulders to her waist.</p>

<p>Chastelâr looked proudly and lovingly at her even then.
Madman! even then!</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam,’ urged Moray, with soothing accents, ‘bethink
you, I beseech your Grace. In the name of prudence
and discretion, bid me not dip my hands in the blood of this
man. Remember, you have yourself treated him with over-courtesy
and kindness, to the offence of your nobility, and,
pardon me for saying it, to the scandal of the Court. Reflect,
madam, what shall the world think of it when they hear that
a queen’s musician was found in a queen’s bed-chamber, and
put to death lest he should tell the tale.’</p>

<p>The Queen raised her head with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>‘You <em>dare</em> to shield him, Moray! You! my own blood!’
she vociferated. ‘On your allegiance, I charge you. What!
You will never let him speak! To the death with him on the
spot!’</p>

<p>But Moray knew the pliant and forgiving nature of her with
whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam,’ said the prudent earl, ‘patience; I entreat
you, patience; the unhappy man is clearly distraught; let us
not shed his blood unwittingly. He shall be brought to justice,
and punished according to his deserving; so shall his
treason be sufficiently expiated by death. Remove him,’ he
added, speaking composedly to the men-at-arms, who crowded
round the door. ‘Bind him forthwith, and let him be placed
securely in ward.’</p>

<p>Chastelâr still remained perfectly immovable; never once
had he taken his eyes off the Queen’s face; never once had
the strange longing, loving gaze, with its dash of wild triumph
and its depth of intense affection, faded or varied for an instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
While they bound him fast, drawing a girdle tight
round his arms above the elbow, he neither seemed to feel the
pressure, nor to be conscious of the indignity; while they
pressed round him and hustled him from the room, his looks
never strayed for an instant from the Queen.</p>

<p>All this Mary Hamilton saw as if in a trance. Though
every stroke of her pulse beat with a loud stupefying clang
upon her brain, she knew that this was reality, that this was
truth, that there was no hope of awaking to find it all a
dream; but when Chastelâr reached the door, and beholding
the Queen no longer seemed roused to consciousness at last,
she met his eye for the first time, and the whole hopeless
misery of her situation rushed upon her at once.</p>

<p>He smiled on her very sadly and kindly; there was a pitying,
remorseful expression in his face&mdash;a wistful, mournful
tenderness in his glance: she could bear it no longer, and she
fainted dead away upon the floor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Although the gayest of the gay, where revelry was in
the ascendant, and gifted with that tameless courage
and those qualities of endurance which were the characteristics
of her family, alas! too often proved in the reverses of
that ill-fated line, Mary Stuart was subject to constitutional
fits of dejection, the more painful that she struggled bravely
against the incubus; and, however much it may have darkened
her spirits, never suffered it to affect her temper. The Queen
was always kind, considerate, and smiling towards her household,
even while her eyes were full of tears, and her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was sore with undefined anxieties and anticipations of evil for
which she saw no obvious cause. Her Majesty was generally
more free from such depressing influences at St Andrews than
elsewhere. The keen sea-breezes of that bracing locality
seemed to have a favourable effect upon her health, and she
enjoyed, above all things, the absence of state and ceremony,
on which she specially insisted in the old cathedral town.
Fond as she was of the saddle, it was a great pleasure to the
beautiful Queen to gallop over the spacious sands that skirt
St Andrews Bay, where she could enjoy a stretch of two miles
and more, to the mouth of the river Eden, careering along on
the firm hard surface, with the spray of the German Ocean
wet on her cheek, and her horse’s feet splashing amongst the
spent waves of the receding tide. Then she delighted to fly
her hawk at the wild fowl abounding a mile or so inland,
returning by the well-known chain of grassy, sandy hillocks,
that are there called links, and devoted in modern times by
the Scottish gentry to their national recreation of golf.
Sometimes crossing the Eden at the shallows near its mouth,
she would roam over the waste of low grounds that stretch to
the northward, perhaps as far as a small straggling hamlet, in
days of old a Roman settlement, defended by one of their
masterly encampments, and called by the legions, <i>Lochores</i>&mdash;a
Latinism which the Scottish peasant of to-day reproduces
in the name of Leuchars.</p>

<p>Then, on her return from these joyous expeditions to the
small house in the South Street, selected for her own royal
residence, she gathered her few intimates and friends around
her, and passed the evenings in amusement and hilarity, from
which the very name of business was rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>To one who was so staunch a supporter of the faith in
which she had been brought up, not the least attractive feature
in this picturesque town was its beautiful cathedral, that
goodly edifice which the over-zealous followers of John Knox
thought it no sacrilege to devastate, and of which a fine ruin
alone remains to suggest to us what it must once have
been.</p>

<p>The antiquary prowling about the moss-grown flag-stones
that pave its aisles, or prying into nooks and corners of sinking
buttress and mouldering walls, finds memory sharpened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and curiosity stimulated at every turn. The philosopher,
contemplating the length and breadth of that spacious area,
heretofore rich with the decorations of architecture, and glowing
in the pomp and pageantry of Romish piety, recalls the
solemn music, the swinging censers, the carven images, the
twinkling lights, the florid altar, the gilded crozier, and the
mitred abbot, with his train of monks and choristers winding
solemnly up the dusky nave. He speculates, half-pitying,
half-sneering, on the various modes in which men offer their
homage to the true God&mdash;the Mollah exhorting the faithful
Moslem from a minaret, the priest pattering Latin in a corner
before a crucifix, the precentor’s nasal psalmody quivering
within the unsightly walls of a Presbyterian meeting-house&mdash;and
he reflects that the forms of religion change like the
fashion of a garment, and that the offertory of yesterday becomes
the superstition of to-day, and the mummery of to-morrow;
but the Christian, looking upward to that ruined arch,
through the stained glass of which, as through a prism, the
light was wont to stream with rainbow colouring, sees the
blue sky of heaven smiling changeless in its span, and rejoices
to believe that clear as the blessed light of day is the light of
piety, penetrating the disguises and the ceremonials and the
ignorant prejudices of weak humanity, like the sunshine that
vivifies as surely the dusky slab lurking in the gloomiest
corner of the cathedral, as the fresh daisy raising its head on
the free mountain side. What matters the fashion of the
cup, chased in gold, or of broken pottery, so the parched lips
can but drain their fill of the waters of life?</p>

<p>It was the Queen’s habit to devote the early part of the day
to such affairs of state as would not excuse neglect, even at
St Andrews, and to the usual household duties, which every
lady in the land, royalty included, then found to occupy a
considerable portion of her time. At twelve, she dined
temperately and hastily, after which she mounted her horse,
and, accompanied by as small a retinue as possible, devoted
the afternoon to exercise and amusement.</p>

<p>It was on the second day after her arrival at St Andrews
that she agreed to Mary Hamilton’s request, who begged that
she might be allowed to accompany her mistress in the daily
ride. The Queen had seen with concern the sad change that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
had come over her favourite’s looks, and although surprised
at this departure from her usual habits (for the maid-of-honour
was a timid and unskilful horsewoman), willingly acceded to
a proposal that promised to bring back the colour to her cheek
and the light to her eye. With a couple of men-at-arms and
a page, as their sole escort, they left the town by its southern
gate, taking the horse track that led to the broad expanse of
Magus-Muir, a locality destined in subsequent troubles to obtain
an odious celebrity for the murder of Archbishop Sharpe
at the hands of the Covenanters, but only interesting to Mary
and her courtiers that it was rich in an abundance of wild
fowl.</p>

<p>Chastelâr had been already tried on the charge of high
treason, and sentenced to death; he was to be beheaded the
following morning at daybreak. It was perhaps natural that
neither Mary nor her maid-of-honour should have exchanged a
syllable concerning his fate.</p>

<p>The Queen was riding ‘Black Agnes.’ As soon as they
were clear of the town, she put her horse into a gallop, and
never drew bridle for several miles. It did not, however,
escape her Majesty’s observation that the animal on which
Mary Hamilton was mounted, a bay of great strength and
spirit, usually uncontrollable by the gentle hand of a lady,
was going in a perfectly docile and collected form; also, that
the girl seemed to-day perfectly free from the timidity which
commonly left her miles behind her mistress in these scampers
across a country. They had already lost sight of the sea, and
had gained a wild inland district of moss and moor, varied
here and there with patches of cultivation, and interspersed
with a few fir-trees of stunted growth, and an occasional cairn
of stones breaking the level sky-line, when the Queen pulled
up at the top of an acclivity, and pointing to a solitary horseman
stationed, as if expecting them, at the foot of the slope,
observed to her companion, with a wild attempt at cheerfulness
obviously forced&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You scarcely thought, Mary, I was entrapping you to
witness a <i>rendezvous</i>. It is a romantic spot for the purpose,
nevertheless, and yonder is the gallant who has kept tryst
with me as he promised, faithfully enough.’</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton would have felt it an unspeakable relief to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have burst into tears. The whole fabric of her morning’s
work was swept away by the sight of that plain dark figure, so
stationary yonder on his horse. She would have given her
life for half-an-hour’s conversation with the Queen alone, although
(strange inconsistency) she dared not ask her indulgent
mistress point-blank to accord her that trifling favour, and
now, this hateful stranger would probably hang about them
all day, and to-morrow it would be too late. A thousand
shadowy and incongruous impossibilities crossed her brain,
too, at the same moment, all turning upon the one sickening
certainty, that even while she grasped at their consolations,
she felt too surely it would be out of mortal power to avert.
She answered with a ghastly smile that startled the Queen,
and totally unconscious of what she said the while&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Let us go to meet him, madam; it may be that he can
give us some hope.’</p>

<p>Mary stared at her attendant vaguely, and shook her head,
then, putting her horse in motion, descended the slope towards
the solitary traveller, flushing a brace of wary old moor-fowl
and a curlew, while she plunged and scrambled with characteristic
fearlessness through the broken ground that intervened.</p>

<p>The horseman dismounted as she approached, and did her
homage with a grave dignified air, not without something
of caustic humour that recognised the peculiarity of the
situation.</p>

<p>‘I might not fail to do your Grace’s bidding,’ said he,
‘even in so light a matter, as to see you fly your hawk
on Magus-Muir, but in good faith, madam, a younger cavalier
could scarce have ridden harder than I have done since
sunrise, and my old bones ache to some purpose for my
punctuality.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, Master Knox,’ answered the Queen, with marked
favour, ‘those of your blood have been ever willing to set foot
in stirrup at the bidding of the Stuart, and I have been taught
to believe that a black cassock may cover as stout a heart and
as loyal as a steel breastplate. Behold, I have here a fitting
reward for your punctuality, to be given with the cordial good
wishes of your Queen.’</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Mary drew from her bosom a crystal watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of curious and elaborate workmanship, large, substantial, and
of considerable thickness, but esteemed a triumph of mechanical
ingenuity, and presented it to the gratified Churchman,
with a charm of manner that increased the value of the gift a
thousand fold.</p>

<p>He bowed low over the royal hand that proffered so
flattering a favour, and mounted his horse once more with
an air of extreme satisfaction and the ready alacrity of a
youth.</p>

<p>So far all was progressing smoothly, but Mary Stuart,
judging of the human temperament by her own, was persuaded
that the exhilarating influence of a gallop would produce
the mollifying results she desired, and render even stern
John Knox malleable to the purpose she had in view.</p>

<p>‘Ye are not so strict,’ said Mary, ‘but that ye like well to
see a fair flight, and I have a hawk here, Master Knox, that
hath not her equal on the wing this side the sea; nay,’ she
added playfully, as he seemed about to excuse himself, and
muttered something of ‘business’ and ‘distance,’ ‘ye have
thought fit to reprove all my other amusements, my feastings,
and fiddlings, and masquings, and such-like, nor have I borne
you any grudge, for that I believed you to be sincere, but ye
love a good horse well I know, and can reclaim a hawk, for
all your solemn bearing and grave studies, with the best of
us. By these gloves, I will never forgive you, an’ ye join not
my pastime to-day.’</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the Queen signed to her page, who came up
with a beautiful falcon on his wrist. The bird was transferred
to Her Majesty, and seemed to shake its bells more gaily, and
raise its hooded head more proudly, as though it knew and
loved the hand that sleeked its neck-plumage with so gentle
a caress.</p>

<p>The churchman was nothing loth. Despite a weak frame
and failing health, his bold ardent nature, the same disposition
that under different circumstances would have made him
a soldier, a statesman, an explorer, or an adventurer, bade him
take delight in the free air of the moorland and the stride of
a good horse. He settled himself in the saddle, gathered his
reins, and professed his readiness to attend Her Majesty.</p>

<p>‘These creatures,’ said he, arguing down some scruples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
his own which much enhanced the promised gratification,
‘are given for our lawful recreation. Man is doubtless lord
over the beasts of the field. I will stay to witness one flight
of that long-winged falcon; ’tis a goodly bird indeed if I know
aught of the craft. One flight, and so crave your Majesty’s
licence to depart.’</p>

<p>The Queen smiled her assent, and galloped merrily on to a
waste marshy surface, where the tramp of their horses ere long
flushed a wisp of wild-fowl, and Mary, throwing her hawk in
the air, was soon scouring over the moor at a break-neck
pace, her eyes fixed on the sky, and her whole attention absorbed
by the gyrations of her favourite.</p>

<p>John Knox, too, casting aside for the moment his cares and
responsibilities, entered into the sport with the eagerness of a
boy. It was seldom indeed that zealous man shared in any
of the lighter amusements of the time; but in pleasure as in
business, whatever he found to do Master Knox went about
with his whole heart and soul. The wrinkles seemed to
smooth themselves on his brow as the wild wind swept back
his thin gray locks, and he felt ten years younger, while the
blood leapt warm in every pulse, and he urged his steed forward
with leg and rein in the excitement of the flight.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton rode like a woman in a dream. The bay
horse, accustomed to fret and chafe under the restraining influence
of the bit, seemed bewildered by his unusual freedom.
He had plunged and bounded away with his head in the air,
according to his wont, prepared for a contest in which he was
sure to obtain the mastery, and he may or may not have been
disappointed to find that his rider’s carelessness of consequences
exceeded his own, and that he was suffered to exhaust
his mettle far more rapidly than he expected. With a stony
white face, and her abundant hair streaming over her shoulders,
the maid-of-honour sat back in the saddle, and flew
along at a pace that even ‘Black Agnes’ could not surpass,
unconscious apparently of amusement, or danger, or excitement,
or anything but the relief afforded to her mental anguish
by the physical sense of being carried with such velocity
through the air. When the mallard was struck to earth at
last, and the horses were pulled up, with panting sides and
dilated nostrils, and wild eyes all a-glow with excitement, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Queen gazed on her reckless attendant in surprise, and even
the severe Reformer remonstrated with her, Popish damsel
though she were, for the utter disregard in which she seemed
to hold that white neck of hers, and the probability of breaking
it in such a headlong career.</p>

<p>‘Fair mistress,’ quoth Master Knox, ‘there is reason in all
things; over-caution supposes want of faith, but the contrary
extreme, such as you have exhibited to-day, denotes presumption
and fool-hardiness. You are young; humanly speaking
you have many years before you. You would not willingly
be cut off like a flower in its bloom. Why should you thus
risk your life as if there was no to-morrow?’</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him. She answered nothing, but
the last word of his sentence seemed to strike some chord
within her, for she turned away muttering below her breath,
‘To-morrow. It will be too late to-morrow,’ and clasped her
hands upon her breast as if in pain. John Knox did not
observe her, for his attention was now taken up by the Queen,
who seeing in his face, which was bright with repressed excitement,
that the propitious moment had arrived, motioned him
to her side, and moving her palfrey out of ear-shot of the
others, broached the subject that had led her to invite him
thus to join in her favourite amusement.</p>

<p>‘I have brought ye a long ride, Master Knox,’ she said,
‘and I would ye could return and taste a cup of sack at our
poor lodging in St Andrews, but I know your busy avocations,
and that ye will not willingly be absent from Edinburgh a day
longer than is necessary. Ere you depart, I would fain ask
your opinion on a subject of toleration.’</p>

<p>At the ominous word, the divine’s whole countenance
changed as the sky changes after a chance blink of sunshine
in December. The clouds of controversy gathered on his
brow, and suspicion gleamed in his cold piercing eyes. The
Queen saw the storm brewing, and added, with a pleading
sweetness few men would have been able to resist, ‘The sun
smiles on all alike; the blessed rain of heaven falls on the just
and on the unjust. Which of us shall penetrate our neighbour’s
motives, or judge our neighbour’s heart?’</p>

<p>‘Ye shall have no dealings with the ungodly,’ replied Knox,
hastily, with an instinctive prescience of what was coming;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
‘the Amalekite is to be smitten root and branch till he be
destroyed out of the land. But I anticipate your Grace, and
have not yet been favoured with your commands.’</p>

<p>He took himself up shortly, as though aware and a little
ashamed of his ill-manners. The Queen, reining in her horse,
proceeded with great earnestness.</p>

<p>‘The spring is now approaching, and you know with what
devotion we, of the Catholic faith, look forward to the solemnities
of Easter. I am not ashamed to solicit your interest
that my fellow-religionists should be suffered to observe that
festival with their accustomed ceremonies unmolested. I
know too well the feelings of the party who call themselves
the Reformed Church. I know (none better, and ye cannot
deny that I have reason) Master Knox’s influence with that
powerful majority, and his sovereign entreats him thus in
confidence to exert it in the cause of charity and peace and
good-will amongst men.’</p>

<p>It was a powerful appeal from a monarch to a subject,
especially under the peculiar circumstances of the moment.
Riding alone over the breezy upland with that beautiful
woman, under the exciting influence of wild scenery and an
inspiriting gallop, the heart softened by the smile of nature,
and the blood tingling with exercise, few men but would have
found it impossible to resist a suppliant, who was at the same
time a Queen, and <em>such</em> a Queen. Loyalty demanded obedience,
self-interest whispered the advantages of royal favour,
and the impolicy of refusing a sovereign, ambition drew a
dazzling picture of the eventual triumph of the cause wrought
out by the judicious concessions of one man alone, and that
man venerated as the great pillar of Protestantism in Europe;
but conscience thundered ‘No;’ and to do Knox justice, he
never wavered nor hesitated for an instant. His lineaments
looked more rugged, his brow more uncompromising than
usual, when he rejoined&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Your Grace has addressed me frankly, and as frankly I
reply to you. If by holding up my finger I could retain for
the Church of Rome any one of the privileges that are daily
and hourly slipping from her grasp, if by so doing I could relieve
her from one of the least of the indignities or calamities
which are surely gathering round her head from the four quarters
of heaven, see, madam, as I ride here a living man before
you, I would keep it clenched down by force till the nail grew
through the palm of my hand! I am a soldier, I will not desert
my banner; I am an heir, I will not alienate my birthright;
I am an honest man, I will do my duty at all hazards,
in the face of every prince in Europe.’</p>

<p>He looked sublime while he spoke; the weak, ungainly
figure reared itself in the saddle with all the pride of a Colossus,
and never a belted earl could have borne a nobler front in
coronet and ermine than did that minister of the Church in
the fearless integrity of his purpose. Mary grew pale with
anger and disappointment; nevertheless she had long since
learned the painful lesson of self-control, and she forced herself
to speak calmly, while her very blood was boiling within.</p>

<p>‘Would ye refuse to others the liberty of worship ye exact for
yourselves? Would ye persecute men who differ from you
only in their mode of worship, more ruthlessly than the pagan
emperors persecuted those early Christians who were our
teachers as well as yours? Bethink ye, Master Knox, this is
a world of change. The old faith hath many staunch supporters
still. Men’s minds may alter as they have altered ere now,
and those who are all-powerful to-day may find themselves
petitioners for mercy to-morrow. Is it well to exasperate beyond
endurance those who may in their turn come to have the
upper hand?’</p>

<p>The implied threat was injudicious and ill-timed; she
would have done better, knowing with whom she had to deal,
either to have given vent to her indignation and defied him
outright, or to have repressed it altogether; but she was only
a woman after all, and womanlike, could not entirely separate
the two sensations of anger and fear, so she adopted those
half-measures to which her sex is fain to have recourse in a
difficulty, and roused his spirit while she tried to work upon
his apprehensions.</p>

<p>‘I defy the Romish Antichrist as I defy the principle of evil
itself,’ replied Knox, with kindling eyes and excited gestures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
‘Am I watchman set upon a hill, and shall I leave my post
because the enemy is at hand? Am I a shepherd in the wilderness,
and shall I abandon my flock because the storm is gathering
on the horizon? No, madam, once again I tell you that if
you count on my allegiance in this matter, I renounce it; if
you depend on my loyalty, I am a rebel!’</p>

<p>‘It seems so,’ she replied very coldly, and yet there was a
tone of utter sadness and desolation in her voice that smote on
the Churchman’s heart. With looks of tender pity and concern,
such as a father bends upon a favourite child, he would
have argued with her once more, would fain have expounded
to her the fallacies of her doctrines, and recalled her from the
way which he conscientiously believed to be the very high
road to destruction; but as is often the case in such disputes,
the more one yielded the more the other encroached, and she
cut him short with haughty impatience, reining in her horse,
and pointing with outstretched arm towards the south.</p>

<p>‘Yonder lies your homeward way, Master Knox,’ said the
Queen, ‘and here is mine; I sent for you to listen to my
proposals, not to hear your pulpit declamations at secondhand.
When next we meet, others may have found means to
tame that haughty spirit, and the avowed rebel may be glad
to solicit pardon from his sovereign. I have no further need
of you; you may depart!’</p>

<p>The dismissal was as peremptory as it was unceremonious;
though burning to reply and charged with argument, he could
not pretend to misunderstand it, and unwillingly withdrew.
Ere the tramp of his horse had died out on the heathery sward,
Mary burst into a passion of tears which she could no longer
control; then bending her head low to her horse’s neck, put
‘Black Agnes’ once more to her speed, and followed by her
attendants, galloped off in the direction of St Andrews.</p>

<p>Independent of her own private sorrows and distresses, the
Queen’s political position was at this time one of peculiar
difficulty and anxiety. A sincere Catholic, and consequently,
from the very nature of her faith, an ardent upholder of its
infallibility, and advocate for proselytism, she was compelled
by the exigencies of her station to give countenance to its most
determined foes. Not only did she see its tenets repudiated by
the great majority of her people, but the very toleration they
extorted for themselves, was denied to her, and it was a subject
of open discontent that the Mass, which had been suppressed
elsewhere, was suffered to be performed in the Queen’s
own chapel at Holyrood. The very adviser on whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
placed the utmost reliance, her half-brother, the Earl of Moray,
was the chief support of the Protestant party in her kingdom.
And although Seton and a few more of her nobility remained
secretly attached to the old faith, their number was comparatively
trifling, and their zeal scarcely proof against the temptations
of ambition and self-interest.</p>

<p>Then, as if her difficulties were not sufficiently perplexing
without foreign interference, her relatives, the Guises, lost no
opportunity of reminding her that they looked to her alone
for the restoration of the Religion in Scotland, and eventually
over the whole of Britain; whilst a strong party in Spain furnishing
her, for aid, with nothing but unasked advice, actually
reproached her for lukewarmness in the cause to which she
was sacrificing day by day her authority, her comfort, her very
safety, and to which she was so sincerely attached, that, rather
than resign it, she would have lost, as she afterwards did lose,
her crown, ay, and the head that it encircled.</p>

<p>The insults levelled at her person, through her belief, constantly
goaded her to anger, which prudential considerations
urged her to suppress; and when pictures were paraded before
her in the streets, ridiculing all that she held most sacred, and
priests maltreated in her own chapel for the performance of
their ritual and hers, it is painful to imagine the feelings of a
sensitive woman and a Queen compelled to forego her revenge,
and even to court the favour of those undutiful subjects who
had originated such overt and outrageous scandal.</p>

<p>No wonder she galloped on with burning cheeks and swelling
heart, reflecting only on the failure of her benevolent
scheme so thwarted by the obstinate integrity of Knox, and
insensible as the very horse that carried her to the beautiful
scene opened out at her very feet.</p>

<p>Before her lay the noble sweep of St Andrew’s Bay, framed,
as it were, in its golden sands, that stretched far to the north
along the coast of Forfarshire, till their tawny line was lost in
the distant ocean at the jutting promontory of the Red-head.
Clear against the blue expanse, clotted here and there with a
white sail, rose the delicate pinnacles of the cathedral, supported
on the right by the bluff square tower of St Regulus,
firm and massive like some bold champion, proud yet careful
of his charge. On the left, far out into the water, stood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sea-girt defences of the castle, while between these prominent
objects many a graceful arch and pointed spire denoted the
churches and colleges adorning that stronghold of learning
and piety, refining the taste with their exalted beauty, whilst
they carried the eye upwards towards heaven. Below these,
the smiling town, with its white houses and gardens scattered
more and more as they neared the water, straggled downwards
to the beach; and, beyond all, the broad sea lay, calm and
mighty in the serenity of its majestic repose.</p>

<p>On her bridle-hand, Mary might have scanned the wide
champaign of two counties, through which two rivers ran in
parallel lines to the ocean, the intermediate space dotted
with woods and rich in cultivation, the river Eden gleaming
like silver in the foreground, the smoke of Dundee floating
white against the dark heights of Forfarshire, as it followed
the downward current of the Tay, and in the far distance,
the dim outline of the noble Grampians, losing their
misty tops amongst the clouds that streaked the placid sky.</p>

<p>Yet Mary marked nothing of this. With a flushed cheek,
with a drooping head, and, oh! with a cruel sorrow at her
heart, she galloped on, and never checked her pace, nor addressed
her attendants, till she reached the gate of the ecclesiastical
city once more.</p>

<p>Then she drew rein, and as they rode together up the South
Street, she blamed herself that she had not sooner observed
and taken pity on Mary Hamilton’s obvious exhaustion both
of mind and body.</p>

<p>The bay-horse was, ere this, reduced to a state of abject
submission and docility; the bridle, on which he was wont to
strain so eagerly, lay loose upon his neck, and he seemed to
be looking about for his stable with a very wistful expression
of fatigue and discomfiture; but his rider’s face was pale and
rigid, while her eye was wide open, and her mouth firmly set;
she seemed unconscious of all that was passing around her,
and disclosed that vacant, yet pitiful expression of face which
is only to be seen in those who walk in their sleep, or who
are undergoing some racking torture of mind by which their
outer faculties are benumbed.</p>

<p>‘You are weary, child,’ said the Queen, kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> ‘I should
have remembered you are not so indefatigable a rider as
myself. Well, we are at home now, and I shall not require
you again this evening.’</p>

<p>So speaking, the Queen leapt lightly from her palfrey, and
flung the rein to the attending page, but as she did so she
looked once more in the face of Mary Hamilton, who was dismounting,
and something she saw there made her start back,
and exclaim in an agitated whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What is it, child? You frighten me! What is it?’</p>

<p>The other found her voice at last, but it came husky and
broken to her lips.</p>

<p>‘For mercy sake, madam!’ said she, ‘let me unrobe you,
my kind mistress, do not deny me this one favour! Let me
unrobe you, and alone.’</p>

<p>The Queen, though still startled, blushed vividly as something
crossed her mind, that yet seemed partly to reassure
her, and she beckoned her maid-of-honour to follow as she
entered her private apartments, then dismissing her other
attendants, threw herself into a chair, and with the colour not
yet faded from her brow, bade Mary Hamilton unburthen
herself of this dreadful grief that was weighing on her mind.</p>

<p>A burst of hysterical weeping was the result, but it calmed
and relieved the sufferer, until she could find words in which
to offer her petition and tell her pitiful tale. Women are
wonderfully patient of such affections in their own sex, and
the harshest of them will be gentle and considerate with one
of these outbreaks that they have agreed to call ‘nervous
attacks.’ Much more so, kindly Mary Stuart; soothing her
attendant like a child, she soon restored her to sufficient composure
to make intelligible the boon she had all day been
striving to entreat. What this was an hour or two would
disclose. In the meantime, the Queen and her maiden sat
whispering in the darkening twilight, till the shafts and
pinnacles of the neighbouring cathedral loomed grim and
fantastic in the shadows of nightfall, and the light in the
sacristan’s window told that the time of vespers was already
past.</p>

<p>At the same hour, John Knox, riding steadily along the
road to Edinburgh, was beguiling the gloomy journey with a
proud recollection of his resistance to the Queen’s advances,
sternly reminding his conscience that animosity to the Papists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was a Christian’s duty, and that forgiveness was no Christian
virtue to one of another faith.</p>

<p>And Chastelâr in his dungeon was preparing for death by
reflection on the pitiless beauty of her in whose face he would
never look again.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘While hate itself is fain to shrink,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">Where love leaps boldly in.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wind was rising out at sea with fitful sullen moans;
the town of St Andrews was wrapped in thick darkness,
save that at long intervals a light glimmered from some lofty
window, showing where the pale student bent over his weary
labour; the gathering waves rolled in with increasing volume,
breaking heavily against the rocky base of the old castle; but
the sentinel at its eastern angle, though he felt the spray wet
on his face, could not distinguish the white surf leaping and
boiling down yonder in the dark gulf at his feet; the vaulted
chambers, the winding stairs and gloomy corridors of that
stronghold were cold and dismal enough; but what of the
dungeons down below the water-line, where the light of day
had never penetrated yet, where the salt froth oozed and
trickled from the bare rock, and the clammy slime stood on
its chill surface, like the death-drops on the brow of a corpse?
Ay, what of the dungeons? Ask those who were forced down
the narrow stair with pinioned arms and muffled faces, knowing
that their feet would never ascend the slippery steps again!
Ask those who were immured in narrow cells, hollowed like
living sepulchres from the rock, and so built in that the soul,
indeed, might, but the body never could, escape from its imprisonment!
Ask those who were let down by a cord into
the black, loathsome pit from which they never came out
alive! The answer may, perhaps, some day be spoken in
tones of thunder before earth and heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Even now they tell you how the marks of blood remain in
evidence on that accursed keep; how the very stones bear
witness to a foul and murderous deed, none the less guilty
that victim and perpetrators were equally steeped to the lips
in homicide and crime; that it was the accomplishment of
Divine vengeance and the fulfilment of a martyr’s prophecy.</p>

<p>When the proud cardinal, leaning over his window to behold
the frightful holocaust at his ease, smiled bitterly on George
Wishart at the stake, did not his heart sink within him to
hear the martyr’s solemn denunciation?</p>

<p>‘David Beatoun, though the flames shall lick up my blood,
yet shall thine remain to stain the very wall on which thou
leanest, as a witness against thee till the day of judgment!’</p>

<p>When the Laird of Grange and the two Leslies dragged
their enemy from his bed and slew him at that very window,
must not remorse have whispered in the moment of despair
that there is a retribution even here on earth? and when we
learn that the fierce murderers did actually hang his body
over the wall as a butcher hangs a carcase in the shambles, till
the blood soaked and sank into the very stone-work, and that
centuries have not washed out its stains, what can we say but
that the Divine will doth not always postpone justice to a
future world, and that Divine vengeance seldom fails to work
out its own precept, ‘whoso sheddeth man’s blood by man
shall his blood be shed.’</p>

<p>The only cheerful apartment in the castle was the guard-room;
although the night was dark and stormy, the wind
sighing, and the waves beating without, a huge wood-fire blazed
and crackled in the ample chimney, reddening the weather-beaten
faces of the men-at-arms, and glancing fitfully from
their shining head-pieces and bright steel corslets. Small care
had these rude hearts for the weather without or the woe
within; the spray might dash against their casement, and the
weary prisoner moan his wrongs in the neighbouring cell.</p>

<p>‘What would you have? ’tis but the fortune of war,’ quoth
the soldier; ‘my luck to-day, yours to-morrow; a bed of
heather for this one, a lair of straw for that; a free discharge
and a fresh enlistment at last. Put another log on the fire;
I wish we had got something more to drink.’</p>

<p>Their captain sat somewhat apart, his head resting on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hand, and his sheathed broadsword lying idle on the floor.
As the flame flickered on his forehead a frown seemed to pass
and repass across its surface, but his eyes were intently fixed
on the red glow of the embers, and perhaps he was drawing
pictures that had no semblance of reality in their glare.</p>

<p>A moody man of late was Alexander Ogilvy; once the best
of comrades, and the blithest of merry-makers, he was becoming
captious, contradictory, and quarrelsome. The hand stole
to the sword-hilt now on the lightest word of provocation, and
although he was still ready to pledge his brethren-in-arms
with the wine cup, it seemed to be no longer the desire of
good fellowship that stimulated him, but a fierce morose thirst
that he was resolved to slake in gloomy defiance.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the phantoms he was watching in the fire
might have accounted for this untoward change in the young
soldier; perhaps it was not pleasant to picture to himself in
those glowing depths the stately figure of Mary Beton, with
her flowing skirts and quivering ruff, bending her lofty head
so graciously towards a sharp spare man, in gorgeous apparel,
with a clever face and a sneer, that if Ogilvy had ever formed
any idea of Mephistopheles, would have presented to his
mind’s eye the very expression of that sarcastic personage;
perhaps it did not enhance the harmony of the group to recognise
in the hottest corner a figure bearing a grotesque resemblance
to himself, watching the pair with jealous supervision,
and presenting the undignified, if not ridiculous exterior, of
one who runs second in the race of love.</p>

<p>With a movement of impatience he drove his heavy heel
against the logs, dispelling the whole representation at a blow,
and causing the fire to burn out fiercely, and the sparks to fly
in thousands up the chimney.</p>

<p>At this moment a man-at-arms entered the guard-room, and
approaching his captain informed him that two persons at the
gate demanded admittance.</p>

<p>‘Impossible,’ said Ogilvy; ‘the wicket is locked, and the
watch set; bid them go to the devil.’</p>

<p>‘One of them bears the Queen’s signet,’ answered the man,
‘though she winna let it out of her hand. I doubt it’s one
of the leddies,’ he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> ‘an’ I ken the tither yane fine; it’s
daft James Geddes, the fule.’</p>

<p>This altered matters considerably. The royal signet-ring
was esteemed a voucher for any one who bore it, and all
guards, warders, and such officers of the sovereign, had strict
orders to consider it in the light of a direct communication
from Majesty itself. So Ogilvy, taking down a torch from
the wall, proceeded to the wicket in person.</p>

<p>On arriving there, he encountered a female figure, cloaked
and hooded, that after a moment’s hesitation he recognised as
Mary Hamilton, and half-watching over her, half-sheltering
himself behind her, much after the manner of a faithful dog,
but with less expression of countenance than that sagacious
animal, the ungainly figure and broad unmeaning face of
James Geddes, the fool.</p>

<p>Ogilvy knew the maid-of-honour personally well enough;
also, on the universal principle (for though she was not the
rose to him, she had been <em>near</em> the rose), he was disposed to
oblige her for the sake of Mary Beton, and bowing courteously,
begged to know if she had any authority, at that late hour, to
enter the castle.</p>

<p>‘I have come to visit a prisoner,’ replied she in a hard-set
voice, showing him at the same time the Queen’s signet-ring,
which James Geddes watched as if he expected the captain of
the guard would swallow it at a gulp.</p>

<p>Ogilvy bowed and withdrew the many bolts and bars that
secured the wicket, then calling a soldier to fasten them again,
preceded his visitors along the vaulted passage that led from
the entrance to the guard-room. Mary Hamilton shuddered as
she heard the gate clang to behind her; and the fool looked more
than half-inclined to draw back and abandon his adventure at
the outset, but a glance at his protectress reassured the latter,
and the former, seeming, as it were, by a violent effort to adopt
a fresh part, assumed an air of gaiety and carelessness strangely
at variance with her bloodless face and horror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>Arrived in the light of the guard-room, she produced an
ample stone-bottle from beneath her cloak, and placed it on
the rude oak table.</p>

<p>‘The Queen has not sent me to visit her brave soldiers
empty-handed,’ said she, with a wild, dreary smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> ‘While
I am about Her Majesty’s business, I hope they will drink Her
Majesty’s health.’</p>

<p>The fool’s eyes glistened at the sight of the liquor, but once
more he glanced at Mary Hamilton, as the well-trained dog
looks at its owner ere he ventures to touch the tempting
morsel placed before him. The soldiers gathered round with
well-pleased faces; the bonds of discipline were not at that
period drawn so tightly as at present, and a carouse was a
sufficiently acceptable variety to the monotony of a night on
guard. Ogilvy, too, who might, under other circumstances,
have objected to such an employment of those he commanded,
for the reason we have before hinted at, was unwilling to disoblige
one of the maids-of-honour, and set the example himself
by filling a cup to the brim with the strong fiery liquor,
and emptying it to the Queen’s health. James Geddes prepared
to make sport for the rude soldiery, and one and all
disposed themselves around the table for an hour or two of
conviviality.</p>

<p>The fool, although habitually not averse to imbibing as
much drink as he could honestly come by, seemed, on the
present occasion, unusually cautious in his potations, and
whilst he encouraged the laughing soldiers to drink deep from
the stone jar, only put his own lips to the cup that was freely
offered him, and for once appeared resolved to keep his poor
faculties as keenly as possible on the alert. He glanced, too,
ever and anon, at the door by which Mary Hamilton had left
the guard-room, and seemed to watch and listen attentively
for the slightest noise.</p>

<p>It was painful to see the gleams of anxiety that broke at
intervals through the dense stupidity of his broad flat face.
At such times his countenance again assumed the wistful
sagacity of a dumb animal, and instinct seemed to warn him
that he must summon all his faculties to meet some vague
catastrophe for which his reason was unable to prepare.</p>

<p>The soldiers jested with the poor half-witted creature according
to their wont, and as their draughts began to ascend into
the brain, proceeded to coarse practical jokes, and much boisterous
mirth, of which his infirmities were made the butt.
James Geddes, however, never relaxed from his vigilance.
Sometimes a lurid gleam shone for an instant in his eyes as a
grossly offensive insult penetrated even his obtuse nature, and
occasionally he gave vent to his feelings by a low moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
noise, and the rocking of his body to and fro, as was his custom
when more than commonly irritated or distressed; but he
was always careful to fill the soldiers’ cups for them to the
brim&mdash;was always watchful of the demeanour and presence of
their commander; and whilst his glance wandered furtively
to the door, his whole attention seemed painfully on the
stretch to catch the sounds of that voice which it was his
nature to obey with the attachment and fidelity of a dog.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton, after exchanging a few words, in a low
tone, with the captain of the guard, in which an acute observer
might have detected successively the accents of remonstrance,
entreaty, and command, had produced a small lamp from
beneath her cloak, and lit it at Ogilvy’s torch; then taking a
key from his hand, which he seemed to deliver very unwillingly,
proceeded alone towards the dungeon, casting over her
shoulder one glance at the fool, in which caution was speakingly
impressed as she departed. The soldiers were already
launched on their carouse, and Ogilvy, though he seemed
watchful and restless, often starting from his seat, and taking
short turns up and down the guard-room, joined at intervals
in their revelry.</p>

<p>The maid-of-honour stepped cautiously down the winding-stair
that led to the dungeon. Mary Hamilton had nerved
herself for the undertaking on which she had embarked, and
now that she was fairly within the dreaded Castle of St
Andrews, the agitation which had rendered her so helpless all
day, had given place to the calm, resolute bearing of one who
is prepared to succeed in a hazardous enterprise, or die in the
attempt. It was, indeed, a trying situation for a young tender-hearted
woman. The man she loved lay in that loathsome
dungeon, condemned to die; she believed that she alone
could save him. She had the means and the opportunity;
all must depend on her courage and presence of mind. Yes,
she would save him, and her reward would be to see him prostrate
himself at the feet of another! It was a bitter thought,
and yet she never wavered for an instant.</p>

<p>As she reached the door of his cell, she thought she heard
his voice, the well-known voice, rich and melodious even here,
and the sound of her own name made her pause and listen.
He was consoling himself in his prison, this man who was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
die on the morrow, with the illusions of his art. He had
composed a ballad, of which her name was the refrain, and
was singing it himself in his cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She heard it every word, and for a time her composure gave
way. A burst of passionate weeping relieved her, and, drying
her eyes, she unlocked the door and entered the dungeon.</p>

<p>The light she carried streamed on Chastelâr’s figure, dressed
in the very clothes in which she had seen him taken. He was
half-sitting, half-lying, in the extreme corner where the stone
was dryest, and took no notice of her entrance, thinking it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was the jailer, but continued to hum the air he had just been
singing. When he lifted his eyes, however, and recognised
his visitor, he rose at once, with his habitual courtesy, and
bade her welcome to his habitation, laughing pleasantly the
while.</p>

<p>‘You find me poorly lodged, Mistress Hamilton,’ said the
poet; ‘and although I live in a castle I am but scantily provided
with room. It is not for long, however, as to-morrow
morning, I am informed, they mean to remove me to a narrower
chamber still.’</p>

<p>She could not bear to see him thus; again the warm tears
filled her eyes as she gasped&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The doom has gone forth; I heard of it to-day; there is
but one chance left.’</p>

<p>He smiled a sweet sad smile.</p>

<p>‘I have done with chances now,’ said he; ‘I set my all
on one cast, and I do not complain that the luck has gone
against me. It was kind of you to come and visit me, Mary’&mdash;he
dwelt fondly on the name and repeated it more than
once&mdash;‘I was thinking of you even when you appeared. I
was wishing I could see you once more. What of the
Queen?’ he added, with an eager glance. ‘Is she here at St
Andrews?’</p>

<p>‘She sent me to you this very night,’ replied the other.
‘What I do is by her command, and according to her directions.
You shall not die, Chastelâr; she bade me save you,
and we have the means; only be obedient, and, above all,
keep silent.’</p>

<p>His whole face lighted up as he seized her hand and covered
it with kisses. Life was sweet to the poet, with his warm
impulsive nature and his glowing hopes; all the more so when
he learned that he would owe that life to the favour of the
Queen. He listened eagerly while the maid-of-honour detailed
to him the proposed manner of his escape, which,
indeed, seemed feasible enough. She hoped, through the
potency of the brandy which she had left behind her in the
guard-room, and with the assistance of her half-witted confederate,
to bring the soldiers to a state of hilarity at which
the eye is not very keen, nor the suspicions very easily aroused;
while in her whispered conversation with Ogilvy she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
already, with the unscrupulous shrewdness of a woman, made
use of his attachment to Mary Beton to win him half over to
her enterprise. She calculated, at least, on his ignoring her
proceedings; she then proposed to dress Chastelâr in her own
hood and mantle, which, as their statures were not very dissimilar,
would form a thorough disguise, and she had sedulously
tutored James Geddes, who took an unaccountable delight in
the whole proceeding, to conduct the captive to the gate with
the same deference and care as if it were herself. It was difficult
to make the faithful fool understand this part of the plan,
but she had instilled it into him at last. He was to encourage
the inebriety of the men-at-arms to the utmost of his power,
and directly Ogilvy’s back was turned to go his rounds, which
something she had told him would induce the captain to do at
an earlier hour than usual, James Geddes was to return to the
dungeon and summon the visitor to depart. Chastelâr, in
Mary Hamilton’s clothes, would then accompany him to the
gate, and she herself would remain a prisoner in his place.</p>

<p>‘And when they find you here,’ exclaimed the poet, all his
generous impulses protesting against such an arrangement,
‘think of Ogilvy’s rage! think of the rude drunken soldiers!
It cannot, it shall not be! Your life would have to pay the
penalty.’</p>

<p>‘And I would give my life freely for yours,’ she replied, a
bright smile breaking over her face, causing her to look for
the first time to-night like the Mary Hamilton he remembered
in the Queen’s chamber, when all was so different and
so happy.</p>

<p>‘For mine!’ he repeated, with a sadly troubled face.
‘Oh, too late! too late!’</p>

<p>‘Do not say so,’ she continued, speaking very rapidly and
eagerly, with her slender fingers grasping the prisoner’s arm
like a vice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> ‘I would not have told you this but that we
shall never meet again. The very terms on which the Queen
yielded to my entreaties were these: That you leave Scotland
within twenty-four hours, and pledge your honour never to
enter Mary Stuart’s dominions more. Oh, if you knew how
I knelt and prayed and pleaded ere I could wring from her
the token that gave me access here; if you could have seen
her angry frown while I implored, or heard the cold resolute
voice in which she said at last, “I consent, but only on these
terms, that I never behold him more,” you would have pitied
me, Chastelâr; you should pity me now, for though I have
saved your life, oh, I am very, very miserable.’</p>

<p>Again she burst into a fit of weeping, the hot tears fell
upon his hand, but he heeded them not; he scarce seemed
conscious of the devoted broken-hearted woman trembling
there before him; the Queen’s words struck like a poniard to
his heart, and he was mad! love-mad once more!</p>

<p>He broke rudely from his companion; he flung her hand
from his arm, as if the touch were a viper’s; his eye glared,
and he ground his teeth together in the agony of a wounded
spirit, and a pride humbled to the dust.</p>

<p>‘I scorn her mercy!’ he shouted, in wild frantic tones;
‘I renounce her pardon, and I refuse her terms! Tell Mary
Stuart, from me, from Chastelâr, who will be led out to die
at sunrise to-morrow, that the last words he said were these:
“If every one of these hairs were a life”’&mdash;he passed his fingers
while he spoke through the abundance of his dark clustering
locks&mdash;‘“I would lose them all ere I would accept the smallest,
lightest token of the Queen’s favour. Because I have dared
to love her more dearly than man ever loved woman here on
earth; because I love her wildly, fondly, madly still.” Ha,
ha! she cannot rob me of that! Queen though she be, she
cannot recall the past! Mary, Mary! ere to-morrow’s sun
be set, that cold heart shall ache, as it hath never ached yet,
and Chastelâr will have had his revenge!’</p>

<p>And now the pure unselfish nature of Mary Hamilton’s
character rose superior to the crisis. Another who had loved
him less would have turned away in wrathful scorn, and left
him to his fate: not so that gentle, faithful heart; on her
knees she besought him to listen to reason, to yield himself
to her guidance, to accept of life for her sake.</p>

<p>The moments were very precious. Already James Geddes
was beating impatiently at the door, warning them that he
had fulfilled his ministering in the guard-room, and that
Ogilvy was absent for the nonce. She clung to him&mdash;she
urged him&mdash;she implored him, and the man was obdurate,
pitiless of himself as of her, hardened in his despair, reckless,
miserable, and resolved to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>How many before and since have been like him! How
many have turned obstinately from the pleasant easy path of
safety and contentment, to reach wildly at the impossible,
scaling the slippery crag just so high as shall dash them to
pieces in their fall! There are spirits that seem ever destined
to be striving after the unattainable, doomed in a punishment
more cruel than that of Tantalus to thirst for a <i>mirage</i> that
is never even within the bounds of hope. Be it love, wealth,
ambition, their craving seems to be in its very nature insatiable,
and, perhaps, even were the wildest and most extravagant of
their desires to be granted, they would but turn aside indifferently,
as if success must needs be loathsome, and long incontinently
for something else that could never be their own.</p>

<p>It is well for the philosopher who has learned to create for
himself his life’s essentials. Blessed is the barmecide who can
make believe that the tasteless water from his earthen pitcher
is a draught of nectar from a cup of gold. But woe to the
sanguine enthusiast who cannot be convinced that ‘half a loaf
is better than no bread;’ the fool who shouts&mdash;‘all or none,’
for his war-cry, while he runs a tilt against the invincible
windmill of conventionalism, and getting, as he deserves,
none instead of all, has every bone in his body broken into
the bargain for his pains.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton pleaded for dear life; far dearer, indeed,
was that life to her than her own. James Geddes, hearing
her sobs and broken accents, became so importunate at the
door of the cell, that one or two drunken soldiers from the
guard-room, aroused by the noise, came loitering down the
dungeon stair; and, at the same moment, Ogilvy, not in the
best of humours, returned from his rounds, and the last chance
was gone for evermore.</p>

<p>Whether the captain had met with any disappointment in
visiting the different posts under his charge, or whether he had
reason to suppose that his midnight walk was to be more
agreeable than usual, and felt aggrieved to find its dulness
unrelieved by any variety, it is not our province to inquire;
but he certainly showed more zeal for discipline than on his
departure, and entering Chastelâr’s cell in person, after kicking
poor Geddes away with a bitter curse, ordered the maid-of-honour
imperatively to be gone, and summoned two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
soberest men-at-arms to mount sentry for the rest of the night
at the head of the stair.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton neither screamed, nor fainted, nor wept.
She knew that all was over now, and accepted the inevitable
catastrophe with that resignation which Providence seems to
bestow in mercy on those who are destined to endure great
suffering. She bent over Chastelâr’s hand as she bade him a
silent farewell, and though her lips moved as if in prayer, not
a sound escaped them. Then she raised her head proudly,
and walked rigidly and slowly out of the cell, less like a living
being than a figure set in motion by mechanical means. The
boisterous men-at-arms, in the guard-room, stood aside, respectfully,
to let her pass; and James Geddes, as he followed her,
cowered and shook with a mysterious fear.</p>

<p>But Chastelâr, in the selfishness of his great love, so
strong even at the threshold of the grave, scarcely noticed her;
nay, he even called out to her as she departed with a message
for the Queen. The ruling passion was, indeed, strong in
death. As his short and brilliant life had been valued only
for her sake, so she was his last thought now that he stood on
the brink of eternity.</p>

<p>‘Tell her,’ he said, ‘that I commend me to her with my
last breath. Thank her for all her kindness and the mercy
she would have shown me even to-night, but say that I choose
to die rather than be banished from her presence, and so
Chastelâr bids her farewell,&mdash;the fairest, the proudest, and the
best beloved princess under heaven!’</p>

<p>He seemed composed, even cheerful. To all appearance,
the man was in possession of his faculties and in his right
mind, yet these were the last words Chastelâr ever spoke on
earth.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The morning broke dull and gloomy; the wind that had
been blowing steadily all night had subsided towards
dawn, but a chill easterly breeze was still creeping in from
seaward, and a light vapour rested on the surface of the ocean,
beneath which the lead-coloured waves rose and sank in the
sullen monotony of a ground swell. Little by little the cheerless
dawn stole imperceptibly over the rugged bluffs and
scaurs that to the northward formed a bulwark for the town,
and disclosed at every minute new rents and fissures in their
sea-worn sides&mdash;new wisps of dripping sea-weed trailing in ungainly
streaks across their slippery surface; the ebbing tide, too,
receding as though unwillingly, with many a landward leap
and backward whirl, disclosed here and there round black
rocks, peering like the heads of sea-monsters above the restless
waters, while a solitary sea-mew, turning on its white
wing downward from the cliff, screamed, as it were, in disappointment
of its fishing after the storm.</p>

<p>The castle walls rose sullenly against the misty sky; black,
massive, and impenetrable, they suggested no feelings but
those of inhospitable and uncompromising grandeur. Their
battlements, weather-stained with the gales of centuries,
frowned dark defiance down on the ruffled ocean, and the
royal flag, with the golden lion of Scotland ramping in its
folds, half-unfurled and dripping with last night’s brine,
flapped drearily and heavily in the fitful breeze.</p>

<p>To and fro for a space of some twenty yards under the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a female figure was pacing with swift irregular steps, and her
fingers twining convulsively as she held her hands clasped
together before her. Mantle and dress were wet and disordered
from the inclemency of the past night, but the hood
of the former covered her to the brows, and it was only by
the lower part of her white, rigid face, that a passer-by, had
there been one at that early hour, could have recognised Mary
Hamilton.</p>

<p>In a sheltered corner, screened from the wind by a massive
buttress, cowered the ungainly figure of James Geddes; rocking
himself backwards and forwards, he moaned as if in pain,
and blew upon his cold fingers, huddling himself together
for warmth the while, but his eyes travelled wistfully after
Mary Hamilton as she walked, and though she seemed unconscious
of his presence, they never quitted her figure for a
moment.</p>

<p>Once, when close to him, she paused in a listening attitude,
and he took courage to address her, whining like a troubled
child&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Will ye no gang hame? will ye no gang hame? ’Tis
cauld and dreary biding here for sunrise. I’m wantin’ hame;
I’m wantin’ hame!’</p>

<p>She started violently when he spoke; but, turning from
him in impatience, only walked backwards and forwards faster
than before.</p>

<p>And now a dull knocking might be heard in the square of
the castle, and the noise, as of heavy beams put in motion,
broke the stillness of the early morning. At each fresh
sound, Mary Hamilton stopped in her walk, and started on
again as if goaded to exertion by internal agony; the fool
shivering and moaning in his corner, yet still watching her
intently, at length rocked himself off into a fitful half-slumber,
waking up at intervals to implore his unheeding companion
to go home.</p>

<p>Within the castle preparations were already making for some
grave and unusual event. The soldiers, though flushed and
fevered after their debauch, yet preserved an ominous silence,
and betrayed on their coarse faces an expression of pity and
dismay. Ogilvy himself looked pale and sorrowful. Once
when he caught sight of a sharp, polished instrument, propped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
carefully that its edge should not be frayed against a corner,
a tear might have been seen to steal down the captain’s cheek
till it hung in his heavy moustache; but his voice was gruffer
than usual, as he gave some necessary order a minute afterwards,
ashamed, doubtless, as men commonly are, of those
emotions which betray that they have a heart.</p>

<p>Two or three workmen had been already admitted at the
wicket, and were taking advantage of the increasing light to
erect an ominous fabric of boards and scaffolding in the centre
of the Castle square. They went about their job in a prompt
business-like manner enough, but they spoke in whispers, and
when a basket of sawdust was brought out, it was disposed
almost reverently in its place. After this a taint of death
seemed to pervade the atmosphere, and one of the artificers, a
strapping young fellow, six feet high, had recourse to a dram
of strong waters on the spot.</p>

<p>Down below in his dungeon, Chastelâr was asleep. Strange
as it may appear, men always <em>do</em> sleep before execution. Be
it that the faculties are so completely worn out by the wear
and tear of anxiety that usually precedes condemnation, or be
it another instance of the Divine mercy which would fain
shorten that time of agony to the sufferer, such is the fact;
and, in the last moments of criminals, it is almost invariably
the case that body and soul both taste their last
repose on earth, ere the one sleeps and the other wakes for
all eternity.</p>

<p>What were the poet’s dreams in that short welcome rest?
Did he anticipate the great change, and fancy his spirit
already free from its prison, wandering through those unknown
regions which good Eneas, and rich Tullus and Ancus, and
your grandfather and mine, and a host of those we both knew
and valued, and would have followed into any danger, or on
any expedition, have ere this thoroughly explored&mdash;to which
you and I, though we think so little about it, are bound just
as surely and inevitably, and with which to-morrow, or the
day after, or this time next year, we may be familiarly
acquainted? Or did he retrograde to the past, and revel and
ruffle it at Holyrood once more, riding the sorrel horse alongside
of ‘Black Agnes,’ and sunning himself in the bright
eyes of the Maries, and above all the smiles of her their peerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Queen? Perhaps a vision of that face he had worshipped
so fondly shone on him for the last time kindlier and lovelier
than it had ever appeared in reality, and to wake from such
a dream as that was so bitter that even death became welcome
as promising sleep again.</p>

<p>The knocking on the scaffolding failed to arouse him, and
when Ogilvy went gently into his cell with a torch, the soldier
passed the light half-pitifully, half-admiringly, over the
manly face that could look so calm and peaceful at such a
time.</p>

<p>And in the royal house in the south street, within a culverin’s
distance of the castle, were all the inmates sleeping
soundly at the dawn of that gloomy morning? Was that a bed
of rest, on each post of which was carved a crown, and at the
head of which the arms of Scotland were emblazoned so richly
in embroidery and cloth of gold? Was the lovely face, so
flushed and troubled, thus buried in the pillows to exclude the
light of day; were the white hands pressed against the throbbing
temples and covering the beautiful little ears, in dread
of the morning gun which would be fired at sunrise, and tell
that all was over?</p>

<p>It was no fault of Mary Stuart’s that Chastelâr was doomed.
All that lay in her power had been done to save him; all that
royal dignity and womanly shame would permit. Perhaps
she believed him to have escaped even at the last; she would
hardly guess at such infatuation as he had shown even in <em>him</em>,
and yet the victim’s sleep had probably been far sounder than
hers for whom he was about to die.</p>

<p>Lights were burning in the Queen’s chamber, heavy curtains
at the window excluded the faintest glimpse of dawn, yet she
was turning and tossing restlessly on her couch, while Chastelâr
was pacing in grave composure up the dungeon-stair that
led into the gray morning, the last he would see on earth.</p>

<p>But one bed, at least, in the royal house remained cold and
unoccupied&mdash;Mary Hamilton had never returned home all
night. Under the castle wall she kept her weary watch; and,
as the dawn widened into day, she was still pacing hurriedly
up and down, up and down, and at every fresh turn casting a
horror-stricken look towards the sky.</p>

<p>Presently the mist rolled slowly away, curling downwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
from the heights of Craigton and the bleak outline of Drum-Carro
Hill, disclosing the bare and cheerless table-land that
forms the eastern boundary of Fife. The changing wind
cleared the loaded atmosphere, and glimpses of blue became
apparent through the fleecy vapours dispersing rapidly as they
were driven out to sea; already the beams of morning were
gilding the sands of the bay, and two or three fishing-boats,
hoisting their white sails, were putting out hopefully from
the shore; the cheery voices of the sailors came pleasantly over
the water, and reached the ears of the watcher under the castle
wall. Still the hood was drawn over her face; still she paced
with that monotonous tread up and down, up and down; still
the poor fool, crouching under his buttress, moaned and rocked
and shivered, urging pitifully that he was ‘wantin’ hame&mdash;wantin’
hame.’</p>

<p>Then, though the castle yet remained a huge black mass in
deep shadow, spire and pinnacle on the cathedral began to
blush and glow in the morning sun; presently, when Mary
Hamilton turned in her walk, her eye was dazzled by his
horizontal beams streaming along a pathway of molten gold
as he rose cloudless from the sea. Retracing her steps, she
saw the whole massive building before her shine out at once
in a flood of warm yellow light; then she stopped short,
bending forward with her hand outstretched, and listening
eagerly.</p>

<p>Comforted by the warmth, the fool rose from his lair and
rubbed his hands together, with an attempt at cheerfulness,
shifting alternately from one foot to the other in a kind of
measured dance, and striving in his vacant, half-witted manner
to attract the attention of his companion.</p>

<p>She neither moved nor noticed him; still in the same attitude,
with her neck bent forward, her hand stretched out,
and the lower part of her face visible beneath her hood, white
and rigid as if cut from marble.</p>

<p>He pulled her cloak impatiently&mdash;‘Come awa’ hame,’ he
whimpered like a child left alone in the dark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> ‘I’m feared
here&mdash;I’m feared here; it’s no sae canny sin’ the dawn.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>He crooned this doggerel over twice or thrice, pointing at
the same time to the wet sand below them, and the black
shining rocks left bare by the ebb; but she never answered
him, for ere he was silent the heavy boom of a culverin broke
on the morning’s stillness, and a wreath of white smoke, rising
above the walls of the castle, floated calmly and peacefully out
to sea. The fool cowered down and hid his face in his hands.
She did not start&mdash;she did not shriek, nor faint, nor quiver;
but she threw her hood back and looked wildly upwards, gasping
for air; then, as the rising sun shone on her bare head,
Mary Hamilton’s raven hair was all streaked and patched
with gray.</p>

<div class="verse">‘“How should I your true love know</div>
<div class="verse indent2">From another one?”</div>
<div class="verse">“By his cockle hat and staff,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And his sandal-shoon.”’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While the grass was growing tall and rank on Chastelâr’s
grave, the beauty that had bewildered and destroyed
him was unconsciously sowing dissensions and intrigues
in half the courts of Europe.</p>

<p>Not only on the southern side of the Tweed did every turbulent
noble and ambitious statesman look to Mary Stuart’s
marriage as, in one way or other, a stepping-stone to his own
aggrandisement, but each of the numerous parties in the state
was prepared to put forward and support its candidate for her
hand, totally irrespective of the lovely Queen’s personal feelings
and predilections. Austria, Savoy, Spain, had also their
claimants for the desired alliance; and it would be difficult
to calculate the multiplicity of schemes and combinations
originating in the desire of possessing the heiress to two kingdoms,
and the most fascinating woman of the age.</p>

<p>Perhaps the proposed union with the Crown-Prince of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
was, of all matrimonial overtures, the most unpopular in Great
Britain; and the Protestant party, now completely in the
ascendant both in England and Scotland, would have resorted
to the strongest measures rather than submit to such an
arrangement.</p>

<p>All the engines of an unscrupulous diplomacy were ready
to be put in motion for the purpose of thwarting Don Carlos,
and over-reaching his emissaries. Nor were Elizabeth and
her agents likely to be restrained by any over-refinement of
delicacy in a matter which concerned the stability of the
English Queen’s power, and the very existence of her government.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mary and her maidens floated, so to
speak, on the surface of all this turbulence and vexation, as
the sea-bird floats with unruffled plumage on the restless
waves. Their life was indeed one of constant variety and
adventure, for their royal Mistress was too thorough a Stuart
not to identify herself with all the difficulties and troubles of
her kingdom, whilst the bonds of affection which riveted her
attendants to her service were but drawn closer every day, by
the dangers and hardships they shared in their huntings and
progresses and judicial proceedings, through the length and
breadth of Scotland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, winter after winter found them established
once more, over their peaceful embroidery, at Holyrood;
beautiful and merry and unchanged as ever&mdash;all but one.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton, though she still showed the same unbounded
devotion to her mistress, the same sweetness of disposition
towards her companions was cruelly altered now.</p>

<p>It is very sad to read in any human face the unerring
symptoms of a broken heart; to watch the eye sinking, the
cheek falling, and the lines about the mouth deepening day
by day; to note the listless step, the morbid craving for solitude,
the painful shrinking from all that is bright and beautiful&mdash;from
a strain of sweet music, a gleam of spring sunshine,
or the laugh of a happy child, as the aching eye shrinks from
light, and, above all, the dreary smile that seems to protest
patiently against the torture, while the sufferer is kind and
forgiving still. We are almost tempted to ask, why should
there be such sorrow here on earth? But we are satisfied and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
reassured, recalling a certain pledge that cannot deceive, remembering
who it was that declared in mercy and sympathy&mdash;‘Blessed
are they that mourn; for they shall be
comforted.’</p>

<p>Her companions could not fail to notice the change that
was thus wasting the very existence of their favourite, and
each, in her own way, strove to show her fellow-feeling and
her concern. Mary Carmichael was, perhaps, the least demonstrative
of the three; but this young lady had of late been
extremely engrossed with her own affairs, and seemed to acquire
additional hardness of character and reserve of demeanour
day by day. Her interviews with the stranger in the Abbey-garden,
always clandestine, and always affectionate, took place
at regular intervals; and she seldom saw Walter Maxwell now,
avoiding, indeed, every occasion of meeting him, and treating
him, when they did happen to be together, with a coldness
and displeasure, which he was the last man on earth to
accept with resignation, and which was gradually, but surely,
estranging his affection from her altogether. He did not see
the longing looks that followed him when his back was
turned; he did not hear the sigh that rose so wearily to her
lips when she was alone; he only thought her fickle, heartless,
ungenerous, and unjust, determined to have nothing more
to do with her, felt hurt and angry, yet very much ashamed
of himself for entertaining either of these sentiments on her
account.</p>

<p>All this time Mr Randolph had not been idle at the Court
of Holyrood, fulfilling his ministering with a tact and energy
peculiarly his own, and valued as they deserved by his bustling
mistress and her astute adviser, the celebrated Cecil.
Wherever there was an intrigue brewing, the English ambassador
was not to be satisfied until he was at the bottom of
it; wherever there was a mystery he sifted it thoroughly;
analysing with diplomatic chemistry its component parts, and
amalgamating the whole into a confusion worse confounded
when he had done with it.</p>

<p>The many marriage proposals to the Queen kept his hands
full, and the contradictory orders he received from his sovereign,
who, with all her great qualities, was sufficiently a
woman never to be quite sure of her own mind for two consecutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
days, by no means tended to simplify or facilitate the
duties of his office. Nevertheless he found time to press his
suit ardently with Mary Beton, insinuating himself sufficiently
into her affections to worm out of her all the intelligence he
could possibly obtain, yet with characteristic caution never
failing to stop short of the boundary beyond which he must
compromise or embarrass himself. And yet Mr Randolph,
with his clever scheming, well-balanced mind, and his thoroughly
disciplined heart, was but human after all: none
other was so pleasant to him as this daily duty of making
love to Mary Beton; her dignity and her beauty gratified
his fastidious taste, and her obvious admiration of himself
could not but make an impression on his callous heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even over him, the hardened man of the world,
stole a soft vision of something better than ciphers, and protocols,
and despatches&mdash;of pleasant words and loving looks,
and little children and a home; but a moment of reflection
brushed all such weaknesses from his path, and the perusal of
a state-paper from Cecil soon restored him to his philosophy.
Then he remembered that in a career like his every stepping-stone
to greatness must be prized and used only as such;
however fair its polish, however valuable its quality, it must
be crushed under his heel to gain a firmer foot-hold, and
spurned in turn when done with, for his upward spring to the
next. Randolph sought out tools for his own purpose in all
directions; when he failed to find an appropriate instrument,
he shaped one to his hand for himself.</p>

<p>Now it had not escaped the watchful eyes of Mistress Beton
that a certain stranger, with whom Mary Carmichael seemed
extremely intimate, came and went at stated intervals to and
from the Court. With all her vigilance, however, she had
never been able to discover the exact object of these frequent
visits. Had she been satisfied that it was a simple love affair,
she might, indeed, on her own responsibility, have stifled the
whole proceeding by authority; but a hint to that effect
hazarded to the Queen had been so coldly received as to convince
her that the intrigue, whatever might be its object, was
carried on with Mary’s cognisance and approval.</p>

<p>More than any of the other maids-of-honour, Mistress Carmichael
had free liberty to come and go as she chose. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
occasion she was closeted secretly with her mistress; and
more than once these private consultations were known to
have been preceded or followed by an assignation with the
mysterious stranger. Mary Beton could not make it out; she
was satisfied that her junior had a lover who was deeply engaged
in a political intrigue. She must have been more or
less than woman had her curiosity not been aroused and her
disapprobation excited. It was a relief to tell Randolph of
her suspicions, and a pleasure to listen to the eloquence of
his gratitude for the confidence thus reposed in him. In
consequence of these disclosures the diplomatist resolved to
cultivate a greater familiarity with Maxwell, of whom he had
never entirely lost sight, and whose honest nature he doubted
not he could mould to his own purposes; the more so that,
in common with the rest of the Court, he was aware of
Walter’s feelings towards Mary Carmichael, which the lover
believed to be inscrutably hidden in his own heart.</p>

<p>To a cynical disposition it is no small amusement to watch
the demeanour of an offended swain. Women, who are
hypocrites from the cradle, manage to conceal their feelings
creditably enough, and we may take leave to doubt whether
these feelings themselves are so engrossing as they would have
the other sex believe; but a man, one of the Lords of the
Creation, who ‘dotes yet doubts, suspects yet strongly loves,’
is an object that may at least be termed deplorable, if not
ridiculous. He always over-acts his part so completely, his
affection of indifference is so transparent, his bearing of
scrupulous courtesy and offended dignity so ludicrous, and
his sudden fits of remorse so unaccountable, that the world
in general contemplates him with comical surprise, and the
object herself regards him with secret triumph and outward
contempt.</p>

<p>‘Treat a woman frankly,’ quoth Lovelace, in his treatise
on this difficult topic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> ‘and, strange as it may at first sight
appear, like a rational creature. This course is sure to produce
a misunderstanding; but remember the sooner there is
a trial of strength the better. Afterwards, if you cannot
preserve a <i>bonâ fide</i> and complete indifference, take care to
absent yourself from the subject under treatment. It is indispensable
never to appear at a disadvantage. If elsewhere,
the subject, whose imagination is vivid, will picture you as
more pleasingly employed than in its society. This rouses
emulation and stimulates self-esteem, of both which qualities
it possesses a large share. When it is satisfied you can do
perfectly well without it; if it has the slightest inclination to
be tamed, it will come to the hand of its own accord; if it
has not, all your pains are but labour thrown away, and only
render you less fitted to cope with such other subjects of the
species as it may seem desirable to reduce to obedience.
Always remember this, that the men whom women love best
are those over whom they have the least influence, and of
whom they stand somewhat in awe.’</p>

<p>Is Lovelace right? We have quoted from memory, but
such is the gist of his theory, the truth of which our own
observations of such matters would lead us to concede; the
difficulty seems to be in reducing it to practice. The generous
nature is more willing to give than to receive, and takes
all the shame and all the suffering ungrudgingly on its own
shoulders.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Malo cum Platone errare.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be better to fail thus, than to triumph with Lovelace.</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell was proud, lonely, and unhappy. It was
under these circumstances that Master Randolph bade him to
dinner in his lodging at twelve o’clock noon, and studiously
avoided asking any other guest to meet him.</p>

<p>The refined taste of the Englishman had gathered about
him even in the northern capital every luxury of which the
age admitted. Good living and diplomacy have ever gone
together, from the roast mutton consumed in council before
Troy to the Nesselrode puddings of to-day.</p>

<p>Honest Jenkin, an invaluable domestic, received his master’s
guest with a grin of recognition. He had not forgotten
their night skirmish on the Border some two years ago, and
after the manner of his kind had assumed a vested interest in
Maxwell for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>‘Master Randolph was in his closet concluding a despatch,’
he said, placing a seat for the visitor in the chimney-corner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
‘The soup would be on the table in five minutes; would
Master Maxwell divert himself in the meantime with examining
these silver-mounted dags? They were pretty pistolets
enough. We would have been none the worse of them that
moonlight night in the “Debatable Land.”’</p>

<p>Maxwell smiled, and whilst Jenkin bustled to and fro about
his hospitable labours, warmed himself at the wood fire and took
a survey of the ambassador’s apartment.</p>

<p>It presented the same medley of refinement and simplicity,
of comfort and contrivance, which may be observed in an
officer’s barrack-room of the present day. Sundry mails and
leather trunks, all adapted for carriage on horseback, were
converted into cases for books and writings, and otherwise
served temporary purposes for which they were not intended.
The massive oaken chairs and tables, rough primitive furniture
belonging to the mansion, were covered by skins and
shawls of considerable value, Randolph’s own property, and
presented to him at different times by the great personages
with whom he came in contact. Costly arms of beautiful
workmanship, richly-chased drinking vessels, and elaborate
ornaments of great value in small compass, that had come
into his possession in the same manner, were scattered about
the apartment. A sword of the finest temper Italian forges
could produce, inlaid with gold and ornamented with precious
stones, the gift of the Duke of Savoy, lay carelessly on a
writing-table across a Bible printed at Geneva, as the inscription
on its leather cover attested, for Mr Randolph’s especial
acceptance; and propped against the hilt of this beautiful
weapon smiled a miniature portrait of Elizabeth, with tightly
curling yellow hair, set profusely in diamonds. Quantities
of papers and memoranda, none, we may be sure, of the
slightest importance, littered the floor; a pair of spurs, a
hawking glove with a set of jesses and a lure, were on the
high chimney-piece, grouped about the beautiful cup that the
Queen of Scotland had herself bestowed on the Minister;
whilst ranged in a semicircle before the fire, ripening and
mellowing in its comfortable glow, stood a row of tapering
flasks, blushing with the goodly vintage of Bordeaux. As
Jenkin appeared with the dinner at one door, Randolph came
forward with his open pleasant manner to meet his guest
through another.</p>

<p>‘Work is done for to-day!’ exclaimed the diplomatist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with the bright air of a boy released from school. ‘Master
Maxwell, you are heartily welcome, once for all. Be seated,
I pray you. Were a despatch to arrive post from my gracious
mistress herself, I should thrust it aside like the noble Roman,
fill me a cup of wine, as I do now, to your health, and say,
“Business to-morrow!”’</p>

<p>‘No man has so good a right to leisure as yourself,’ replied
his guest, doing as he was bid, and returning the pledge
in a hearty draught, ‘for no man gets through so much work
in so short a time. Even Maitland, who is our most accomplished
penman here in the North, vows that he cannot but
marvel at the despatch with which the English affairs are
conducted.’</p>

<p>‘It is all plain sailing,’ replied Randolph, with an appearance
of the most engaging candour. ‘My instructions are
usually so intelligible and above-board that I have but to act
on them without delay. Frankly, my friend, between you
and me, the only complications I have are owing to the mystery
that is kept up about your Queen’s marriage. But this is no
time for business. Fill your cup once more. Honest Jenkin’s
catering requires to be washed down with good wine. The
fare is moderate enough, but at least I can answer for the
liquor.’</p>

<p>Both by precept and example Randolph encouraged his
guest to do justice to his hospitality, and led the conversation
as he well knew how, to such topics as he thought would
most interest a man of his companion’s age and habits.
Horses, hawks, and hounds, wine, women, the latest gossip
at Holyrood, the newest jest from the French Court, and the
recent improvements in warlike arms and tactics, such were
the subjects lightly touched upon in turn, and each was made
the reason or the excuse for a fresh bumper; but all the while
the diplomatist’s attention was never taken off the object he
had in view. Like some skilful chemist, he watched the
gradual fusion of his materials, and waited patiently for the
moment of projection. It did not escape him, however, that
Maxwell was preoccupied and out of spirits; that though he
bore his share in the dialogue courteously enough, it was with
an obvious effort, and that every fresh cup he emptied seemed
rather to drown than to cherish the few sparks of hilarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which he had shown at the commencement of the entertainment.</p>

<p>At a sign from his master, Jenkin set a flask of rich
Cyprus wine on the table, and Randolph, dismissing the
domestic, heaped fresh logs upon the fire, and drew his chair
towards his guest, as if he were growing exceedingly confidential
and communicative.</p>

<p>‘Are you for the revels at the Palace to-night?’ said he,
with a meaning look at the bravery of Walter’s attire. ‘We
may as well go together. In the meantime (we are old
friends, good Master Maxwell), I have something to say to
you,&mdash;of course, in the strictest confidence.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ replied Maxwell, with rather a disturbed
expression of countenance, which subsided, however, almost
immediately into his usual steady composure.</p>

<p>The ambassador filled his guest’s cup and his own.</p>

<p>‘You and I are interested in the same matter,’ said he, not
entirely repressing his habitual cynicism, ‘and such a community
forms the strongest bond of friendship. If I can
prove to you that by helping me you benefit yourself, can I
count upon your assistance?’</p>

<p>‘You must explain your meaning more clearly,’ replied the
other, with something of contempt in his tone. ‘Remember,
I am a soldier, and no diplomatist.’</p>

<p>‘You are a soldier, I know,’ rejoined Randolph, ‘and a
brave one. You are loyal and generous and true. Mr
Maxwell, I will be frank with you. There is an evil influence
at work here, which I think you have the power to
crush. Listen. Would you stand by and see your Queen
deceived and trifled with by a political cabal, of which the
principal emissary is blackening and destroying a reputation
that I believe is dearer to you than your own?’</p>

<p>‘What mean you?’ exclaimed Maxwell, with forced composure,
but putting so strong a constraint upon himself
that the silver goblet he grasped was dinted by the pressure
of his fingers.</p>

<p>‘It is no secret now,’ answered the other gravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
‘Courtiers’ tongues wag freely enough on such subjects, and
you must not be wroth with me for repeating in your own
behalf simply what I hear. It is well known that Mistress
Carmichael, beautiful Mistress Carmichael, cold Mistress
Carmichael, proud Mistress Carmichael’ (he watched the
effect of each epithet in succession on his irritated listener),
‘has taken to herself a friend, an admirer, a lover, call it
what you will, with whom she holds clandestine interviews
in the Abbey garden at night. As I live, ’tis the common
talk of the palace; and people laugh and whisper and sneer
about the spotless Maries, and wonder why the Queen takes
no notice of it. Nay, chafe not with <em>me</em>. In good faith,
man, I do but tell you this as a friend. I have little enough
to do with ladies, you know.’</p>

<p>‘And what is all this to me?’ asked Maxwell, with such
admirable self-command that Randolph could not help thinking
what a pity it was he did not follow out the profession of
state-craft. Nevertheless, every word had struck home, and
although his voice was so steady and his face so calm, the
perspiration stood on his brow, and there was a dangerous
glitter in his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>‘Why thus much,’ returned Randolph&mdash;‘that had this
intriguer, whoever he may be, no claims but his own merit to
the notice of Mary Carmichael, I believe, and those who
know her best affirm, that she would never have condescended
to notice him. But these interviews, granted for some hidden
purpose unconnected with gallantry, are compromising her
till she is gradually falling into his power, and the poor girl
will find herself at last compelled to accept as a lover the man
for whom she does <em>not</em> care, unless she be extricated from her
false position by the man for whom she <em>does</em>.’</p>

<p>‘Meaning me,’ said Maxwell, looking steadily in the minister’s
face.</p>

<p>‘Meaning you,’ replied the latter, continuing in the most
friendly tone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> ‘you have the right, it seems to me, and you
ought to have the will, to unmask this intruder. It is your
own fault, Maxwell, with good friends at your back, if you
have not the power. Come, you may count upon me for one
in this matter. To-night I have reason to believe Mistress
Carmichael will again meet this mysterious personage in the
Abbey garden, whilst the revel is at high tide in the palace.
Follow her to the tryst, confront your rival and compel him
to declare himself, or to do you reason with his sword. If
needed I will be at your back, and should all other means
fail, six inches of cold steel can easily square accounts between
you.’</p>

<p>‘And your reason for thus interesting yourself in my
concerns?’ demanded Maxwell, with a dry laugh. ‘Is it
purely out of friendship for me, Master Randolph?’</p>

<p>‘Now you speak like a sensible man,’ replied the diplomatist,
‘and I answer you with the frankness you deserve.
No! with all my regard for you, this interest, on my part, is
<em>not</em> entirely for your sake. I have reason to mistrust this
stranger; I have my suspicions of some dark plot, against
which it is my bounden duty to be on my guard. If he be a
friend, my plan will at once set matters on a proper footing,
both as regards yourself and the lady of whom we speak. If an
enemy, the sooner he is removed from our path the better.
Have I not convinced you that our interests are identical?
The day wanes; one more cup of the Cyprus, Master
Maxwell, and then, first to the Palace, afterwards to the
garden.’</p>

<p>Maxwell filled and emptied the cup of Cyprus as he was
bidden: but his was a temperament on which wine took
but little effect, or rather, in which it stimulated the faculties
without upsetting the judgment. Even Randolph’s
brain, powerful as that organ undoubtedly was, could
not have been less affected by his potations than was the
soldier’s.</p>

<p>As the pair, ostensibly dismissing the subject from their
minds, talked gaily on about other matters, it would have
been amusing to note the dexterity with which the diplomatist
adapted his conversation to the purpose he had in view. How
with a casual remark here, a covert sarcasm there, he endeavoured
to stimulate the other’s jealousy and to arouse his
alarm, whilst, at the same time, with many a plausible argument
and choice anecdote, introduced as it were by chance,
he endeavoured to establish the expediency of prompt and
desperate measures on all occasions where a man had to deal
with cases of mystery and intrigue.</p>

<p>Maxwell listened attentively, but the inscrutable repose of
his countenance baffled even Randolph’s penetration, and he
contented himself with vague and general replies, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the other could make nothing. Nevertheless, he was resolved
in his own mind what to do. With all his exterior of adamant,
he was sufficiently vulnerable within. Bitterly hurt and
offended at Mary Carmichael’s conduct, he had determined to
forget her; but the old wound was only superficially healed
over, and it would not bear being touched or tampered with
yet. Also his attachment to that young lady had been of the
purest and most unselfish order, and such an affection never
fails to evoke all the latent generosity of a noble heart. His
own impulse, as a gentleman, was to give his rival every fair
advantage; to treat him, at least, as an open and honourable foe;
to warn him that his movements were watched and his personal
safety endangered; and to tell him, point blank, that he
had done this for the sake of her whom they both loved.
Surely such frankness would meet with the return it deserved;
and then, if Mary really preferred this stranger, why, the
dream was over, that was all. Any privation was better than
this continual uncertainty; it was but giving her up, and the
world would be before him again&mdash;something whispered that
it would be a very different world, nevertheless. However,
he made up his mind, and was more than usually merry
with Randolph as they proceeded together towards Holyrood.</p>

<p>It was the anniversary of Twelfth-night, and the feast of
the Bean was in act of celebration with great glee and
splendour when the English Minister and his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
entered the reception-rooms of the Palace. This favourite
pastime, borrowed from the Court of France, has come down
to us in modern days under the form of ‘drawing for king
and queen;’ the bean was concealed in the twelfth cake, and
the dame to whose share it fell was chosen with much mock
solemnity as queen of the night. On the present occasion the
lot had fallen to Mary Beton, and her indulgent mistress,
with that playful good-humour which so endeared her to her
attendants, had insisted on decking the leader of the revels
with the most splendid attire her own royal wardrobe contained.</p>

<p>In case that any lady should condescend to look into the
dry pages of a historical novel, we will endeavour to the extent
of our poor abilities to present the details of a ‘<i>grande
toilette</i>,’ of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>A sweeping robe of cloth of silver, heavy with embroidery
and ornamented with medallions of pearls down the front of
the dress, which was looped backwards at the knee and fastened
with bunches of red and white roses, disclosing a petticoat
of white silk damask, long and ample so as to cover the
feet encased in their satin shoes; at the waist a girdle of
precious stones arched over the hips, and coming downwards
to a point in front, marked the outline of the figure; while a
collar of sapphires and rubies, close round the neck, lurked and
sparkled under the clouds of scalloped lace that composed the
ruff; the sleeves of the gown, open at the elbow, terminated
in ruffles of the lightest gauze, and thick gold bracelets on
the wrists; the hair, gathered into heavy masses at the back
of the head, was dragged somewhat off the temples, so as to
show the delicate ears with their glittering ear-rings; whilst
over the whole figure, relieving its dazzling whiteness, was
thrown a satin mantle or scarf of <i>cramoisie</i>, the well-known
deep rich hue, something between crimson and plum-colour,
which was such a favourite with the elaborate <i>coquettes</i> of that
sumptuous period.</p>

<p>Thus attired, majestic Mary Beton looked every inch a
queen, and had it not been for the presence of her mistress,
simply dressed in her usual morning garb, yet ‘beautiful exceedingly’
where all were beautiful, the maid-of-honour would
have riveted every eye on her magnificent exterior. Randolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
felt a thrill of triumph and gratification when she caught his
attention, something akin, perhaps, to that which is experienced
by the wary deer-stalker while he contemplates the royal stag
with his branching antlers, the pride of the forest, within
point-blank range of his rifle. The Ambassador, however,
had but little time to admire, for the Queen called him to her
with such marked favour immediately on his entrance,
that he felt convinced something of more importance than
usual was in the wind, and resolved, from whatever quarter
it blew, that at least it should not throw any dust in <em>his</em>
eyes.</p>

<p>After receiving very graciously the compliments which Mr
Randolph proffered on the splendour of the entertainment,
Mary darted at him a keen glance of mingled watchfulness
and amusement, then observed carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What think ye of this chamber for a real King and
Queen to hold their state in, Master Randolph? Since it
hath been newly decorated, methinks a King-Consort might
be satisfied with his lodging. Ere another Twelfth-night
comes round, the lot may have fallen, who knows? and these
faithful damsels of mine may have been released from their
vow.’</p>

<p>He stole a look at Mary Beton, surrounded by her mock
courtiers, and immersed in the game of forfeits which they
were all playing with the eagerness of children, and wondered
whether he would like to marry her or not; but he
answered the Queen as if the subject she had broached, so
far from being unexpected, had occupied his attention for days.</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty anticipates the congratulations I am but
waiting an opportunity to offer. May I give my own mistress
joy on your acceding so cordially to her views for your
welfare?’</p>

<p>‘You may do what you have authority for, and no more,’
replied the Queen severely. ‘My cousin can scarce spare me
that master of the horse of hers, whom she so much regardeth
herself, nor am I so scantily supplied with suitors that I need
trespass on her generosity for so precious a bridegroom.
Come, Mr Randolph,’ she added gaily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> ‘this is Twelfth-night,
and we read riddles and play at forfeits. Can you not read
me mine?’</p>

<p>‘Your Grace must condescend to instruct me,’ replied he,
running over his information and calculating probabilities
with inconceivable rapidity in his own mind; also studiously
abstaining from the guess he thought most likely to hit the
mark. ‘Where the prize is of such value, all are so unworthy
that it reduces the competitors to a level. I can aim no
nearer the white than my first shaft, your Grace. A suitor
for such a hand as yours should have some weighty influence
to back him, in addition to unbounded merits of his own.’</p>

<p>‘You seem to have considered the subject deeply,’ said the
Queen, laughing. ‘Come, Mr Randolph, for very pastime
let us hear the qualifications you deem indispensable to an
admirer of Mary Stuart.’</p>

<p>He paused for an instant, enumerating in his own mind the
different qualities of the nobleman whom he was instructed,
at least ostensibly, to put forward, and then proceeded with
an air of the utmost deference and humility&mdash;</p>

<p>‘He should be a gentleman of admirable presence; of
skill in courtly exercises; of varied accomplishments; familiar
with the customs of palaces; brave, noble, and learned; he
should be of no foreign extraction, neither Frenchman,
Spaniard, nor Italian; suitable in point of years, of language,
and of country.’</p>

<p>She nodded archly every time he paused in his catalogue;
then added with an inquiring look&mdash;</p>

<p>‘And of royal lineage as well? Surely like pairs with like,
and a Stuart should only mate with a Stuart.’</p>

<p>It was a home thrust. It corroborated much that he had
already suspected, and explained a good deal that had sufficiently
puzzled even Randolph, but he never winced or
started; to judge by his face it was the communication, of
all others, for which he was best prepared, and whilst he ran
over, as quick as thought, the different combinations to which
such a projected alliance might give rise, and already, in his
mind’s eye, saw the young Lord Darnley, the suitor to whom
Mary alluded, helpless in his toils, he bowed humbly to the
Queen, and begged her to accept his heartfelt congratulations
that she had made her choice at last.</p>

<p>Mary laughed more than ever.</p>

<p>‘Not so fast,’ said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> ‘not so fast. I am discussing
possibilities, Master Randolph, and you are accepting them
for certainties; but enough of this&mdash;amusement is our chief
business to-night. See, the queen of the revels is looking
anxiously this way, and you have not been to pay her your
homage yet. Delay no longer, her displeasure to-night is far
weightier and more implacable than mine.’</p>

<p>As she spoke she dismissed him with a courteous gesture,
and Randolph, nothing loth, commenced paying his court
most assiduously to Mary Beton, with the double object of
spending his time agreeably and worming out of her, ere the
night was past, some corroboration of the Queen’s vague hints
as to her approaching marriage.</p>

<p>It was with secret pride and exultation the Twelfth-night
queen, in all her assumed splendour, beheld the ambassador
approach the circle that formed her sham Court. It would
be too much to say that Mary Beton was deeply in love with
Randolph, but she experienced from his attentions certain
agreeable feelings, that originated in gratified vanity and a
sense of her own superiority to her companions. It was indeed
no petty triumph to have secured the homage of the
fastidious and cynical Thomas Randolph: the man who was
the type of refinement and the incarnation of selfishness,
avowedly a despiser of women and a free-thinker in love.
The pleasure, too, was doubtless in no small degree enhanced
by the care-worn face of Alexander Ogilvy, who continued to
haunt the Court, with a hopeless perseverance truly edifying,
and made himself miserable with the self-immolating regularity
peculiar to a lover, and totally inexplicable on any grounds of
reason or expediency.</p>

<p>Mary Beton had no objection in the world; she liked to
have two strings to her bow. Two! Where is the woman who
would refuse half-a-dozen? With all their vanity and all their
libertinism, thus much we may safely say in favour of the
ruder sex&mdash;a man is usually indisposed to have more than
one attachment on his hands at a time. He may behave
ungratefully, unfeelingly, brutally, to Dora, but it is for the
sake of Flora. For however short a period it may be, yet,
<em>while</em> he wears those colours, Nora looking out for prey in
every direction, shall strive to fascinate him in vain. But
how different is the conduct of the last-named personage:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
brilliant and seductive, it is no reason, because she is herself
in love with Tom, that she should refrain from the massacre
of Jack, Dick, and Harry; nay, if Bill be fortunate enough
to spend an hour or two in her company, away with him to
the shambles too! Shall we pity Nora so very much when
she wears the willow for the faithless Tom, and finds out too
late that she never really cared a pin for the other victims
who, more or less damaged, have made their escape from the
toils?</p>

<p>The wrongs of the sexes towards each other are of the
crudest, and it is generous and manly that our sympathy
should be given to the weaker portion, but the injuries are
not all one way. Many a rugged face is only so grave and
stern because it <em>dare</em> not, quivering there behind its iron
mask, lose for one instant its self-command; many a kindly
heart has turned to gall, many an honest nature been warped
irrevocably to evil, because the pride of manhood forbids it to
ask for that relief which never comes unsought; of course it
serves them right: of course we do not pity them; but are
they the less lost on that account?</p>

<p>It would have moved even a courtier to witness the expression
of sharp pain that swept over Ogilvy’s face when
Randolph led Mary Beton out to dance, but it was gone in a
moment, and nobody detected it save the fair cause herself,
who moved, we may be sure, all the more proudly through the
measure in consequence, and listened, well-pleased as ever, to
the mingled honey and vinegar of the ambassador’s flatteries
and sarcasms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen, followed by her other maidens, glided
through the throng, dispensing her notice graciously to all
her guests, and more especially those whom she had reason
to consider somewhat wavering in their loyalty&mdash;a distinction
not lost upon Mary Seton, who whispered to her companion&mdash;</p>

<p>‘This would be a fine time for poor Bothwell now to come
back again; see, my dear, even Lord Ruthven has had soft
words and kind looks to-night.’</p>

<p>To which the lady addressed, no other than Mary Carmichael,
only answered by a smothered sigh, for that nobleman
was popularly believed to tamper with the Black Art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and to be an especial adept in the compounding of charms
and potions both for friend and foe. She was thinking how
delightful it would be to have one of his specific love-philters
to do what she liked with, and to whom she would give it.
Certainly not to the stranger in the Abbey garden; he loved her
quite well enough already.</p>

<p>Somehow at this moment her eye sought out the figure of
Walter Maxwell, who was standing apart in the recess of one
of the windows, and looking at her with a kind of pitying
sadness, as men do on an object once dearly prized which they
will never see again. It was so unusual now for them to exchange
glances, much less words, that the sight troubled her;
she turned red first and then very pale. He stirred and made
a step forward, as if to advance and speak to her, but seemed
to think better of it, crossed his arms upon his breast, and
resumed his former position. Following the Queen, she was
obliged to pass very near him, and lowering her eyes to avoid
meeting his glance, she was distressed and ashamed to find
that they were full of tears.</p>

<p>There is a mysterious kind of sympathy often existing between
those who have some common cause of suffering. Two
gouty old gentlemen are never tired of detailing to each other
their respective symptoms of <i>podagra</i>; and weak-minded
ladies subject to ‘nervous attacks’ have been overheard to
interchange the most surprising confidences regarding that
remarkable ailment; in the same manner a couple of lovers,
not a <em>pair</em>, are drawn towards each other by a community of
sorrow.</p>

<p>Alexander Ogilvy took his place by Mary Carmichael’s
side, and sought in that lady’s blue eyes, at least commiseration
for his sorrows. Placing a chair for her a little out of
the crowd, he conversed with her on the heat of the room,
the beauty of the dresses, her own successful toilet,
and such like topics, gradually lowering his voice and
bringing the conversation round to the subject nearest his
heart.</p>

<p>‘A bird hath whispered in my ear,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> ‘that we must
look ere long to have a king-consort at Holyrood. The
Maries are more interested in the matter than the whole of
Scotland besides. You will be freed from your vow: choose
each of you a mate, and pair off, like the fowls of the air, ere
another St Valentine be past. What say you, Mistress Carmichael?
sings my little bird true or false? I am no courtier,
you know.’</p>

<p>‘And yet you are much at Court,’ she answered, absently,
‘particularly of late, Master Ogilvy; it was but yesterday the
Queen, pointing you out to Mary Beton, commended the
bravery of your attire.’</p>

<p>Ogilvy coloured, looking very much alarmed, yet not
altogether displeased.</p>

<p>‘And what said Mistress Beton?’ he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>His discomposure was so obvious, that it was well for him
he had not to do with mischievous Mary Seton, or even with
his present companion, had she been in other than a subdued
and melancholy frame of mind. In most women the temptation
to mockery would have been irresistible, but Mistress
Carmichael only replied carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘That you were the properest man at Holyrood, and that
she thought our gallants of the Court wore the French air
more naturally than did the Southrons.’</p>

<p>‘Did she <em>really</em> say so?’ he exclaimed eagerly; ‘and do
you believe she meant it? You know her well, Mistress
Carmichael; is it not true that she is herself too irresistibly
attracted towards the Southron? Do you not think that when
hood and jesses are fairly doffed once for all, she will fly her
pitch toward the border, aye, and strike her quarry far on the
southern side?’</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael followed the direction of his glance to
where Mistress Beton stood radiant in her Twelfth-night
bravery, and listening with a heightened colour and a well-pleased
air to Randolph’s flatteries; but she pitied whilst
she marked the suffering that was too apparent in her questioner’s
gaze, and replied gently to his thoughts rather than
his words&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Gratified vanity is one thing, and real preference another.
A women oft-times likes that suitor best whom
most she seems to avoid. Perhaps for that very reason,
perhaps because she is weak at heart and cannot help herself.’</p>

<p>She spoke the last sentence low, and more to herself than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to him. She was willing to console him, for the deeper a
kind nature is wounded, the more it feels for the sorrows of
others. Also, it may be that she found a certain relief
in repeating the lesson it had cost her so much pains to
learn.</p>

<p>He drew closer to her.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said he, with a beaming look of gratitude.
‘You are a true friend! Believe me, Mistress Carmichael,
I am not ungrateful. Can I serve you in any way in return?’</p>

<p>‘It is no question of that,’ she replied. ‘Our positions
are so different. I only say to you, remember your own
motto&mdash;“To the End.” If I were a man I think I could
trust and hope for ever. I think I could be staunch and unselfish
and true, in defiance of sorrow, suffering, opposition,
nay, even of ingratitude and neglect I would prove to the
woman whom I had chosen that at least she must be proud of
my choice, that a man’s honest affection was no vacillating
fancy, but an eternal truth; and even if she did not love me,
I would force her to confess that it was her own inferiority
of nature that could not mate with mine. But why should I
talk thus to you?’ she added, breaking off with rather a
bitter laugh. ‘You are a <em>man</em>: you cannot understand me;
you will not believe in anything unless you can see it with
your two eyes, and grasp it in your two hands, and be
told by all your friends besides that it is there. If you
had but one gold piece in the world, you must beat it out
thin, and lacker it over your spurs, and your housings,
and the hilt of your sword; you could not hide it away in
your bosom, and keep it unspent and unsuspected next your
heart!’</p>

<p>‘I know not,’ he said with a brightening face; ‘your
words give me hope. I seem to see things differently since
you have been speaking to me. You are my good angel.
Help me; advise me; tell me what I had better do.’</p>

<p>‘In the first place, go and talk to somebody else,’ she
replied, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> ‘You will scarcely advance the cause you
have at heart by whispering with me in a corner. Looks of
inquiry, if not displeasure, have been already shot this way;
and although, perhaps, we are the only two people in this
room who never could be more than friends, courtiers’ eyes
are so sharp and their inferences so good-natured, that they
have probably ere this made their usual grand discovery of
that which does not exist. And so, good Master Ogilvy,
my last word is, think of your motto and speed you
well!’</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she made him a stately curtsey and withdrew
towards the Queen; but Mary Carmichael was right, and
their interview, short as it was, had been remarked by more
than one interested observer.</p>

<p>Though it costs the animal many stripes and much vexation
doubtless to acquire the accomplishment, we have seen a dog
so well broke as to forego at his owner’s word a tempting
morsel placed within his reach, licking his lips indeed and
looking longingly after it, yet exhibiting, nevertheless, a noble
mastery over his inclinations. But let another dog come by
and snatch the bone thus ceded to a sense of duty, and all
his self-restraint vanishes on the instant. Open-mouthed he
rushes to wrest it from the intruder, and that which but a
moment ago was an advantage he could philosophically resign,
becomes immediately a necessity that he will break through
all bounds to attain. So is it with mankind. We can give
up, or rather we fancy we have given up, the one bright hope
that gilded our existence. We see the dear face that used to
make the very sunshine of our heart altered and estranged,
perhaps cold and distant, perhaps turned scornfully away.
We think we can bear our burden resignedly enough. There
is a great blank in our lives, felt less in the time of sorrow
than at those seasons when, were it not for our loss, we think
we should be so contented, so happy. There is a sense of desolation,
a consciousness of old age coming on and being welcome&mdash;a
morbid inclination to receive adversity with open arms; but
yet we man ourselves against the calamity, strong to oppose
and constant to endure. We have not felt the sting yet.
Whilst we are in the cold shade let the dear face beam upon
another; let the tones, so cruel now and hard to <em>us</em>, fall with
the well-remembered cadence on <em>his</em> ear; let him be the
recipient of the thousand tender cares and winning ways that
used to bring tears of affection into our eyes; then, and not
till then, have we sustained the sharpest pain that life has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
inflict; then, and not till then, do we feel that there is no
sorrow like to our sorrow, and that it is well for us it is
transient from its very nature, or heart and brain would give
way under the stroke.</p>

<p>Mary Beton was well satisfied to receive the homage of her
English admirer, and, in order to ensure it, was perfectly
willing to discard her sincerer suitor. Poor Ogilvy might
pine and sigh as he pleased, without gaining so much as a
kind word or an approving glance; but this rigorous treatment
was only to endure so long as she felt he was her
property; the dog’s wages were to be given to the dog’s
honest obedience and fidelity. It was quite a different
matter when he appeared to have transferred his allegiance to
another. Though she did not like him well enough to give
up Randolph for his sake, she had no idea of losing him altogether.
Even if she had no use for him, he had no right to
belong to any one else, and it was with far more of anxiety
and concern than usually overspread those calm features that
Mistress Beton glanced continually towards the corner where
he was whispering with Mary Carmichael, while she listened
to the smooth phrase of the English ambassador with an
absent air and a forced smile.</p>

<p>Nor was the stately maid-of-honour the only person in that
noble assemblage who felt acutely the difference between the
active and passive moods of the verb ‘to give up.’ Walter
Maxwell, hurt, jealous, and indignant, had for long accustomed
himself to look upon Mary Carmichael as one who
was dead to him for evermore; had trained himself to meet
her coldly and calmly when their respective duties brought
them unavoidably together, and to shun her on all other
occasions with scrupulous self-denial; nay, was beginning to
find a certain gloomy satisfaction in the violence he was
capable of doing to his own feelings, and a certain savage
triumph in the reflection that he, too, could be as unkind and
heartless and indifferent as a woman! But when he saw her
thus engrossed with Ogilvy’s conversation, evidently of a
mysterious and interesting nature; when he marked, as he
did at a glance, the softened expression of her face and the
wistful tenderness in her blue eyes, he experienced a sensation
of pain once more, to which he had thought he was henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to be a stranger, and felt again for an instant as he had
felt that well-remembered night when he came upon her so
unexpectedly at her tryst in the Abbey garden.</p>

<p>The same cause produces strangely different effects upon different
individuals. Whilst Mary Beton, under the influence of
jealousy, was becoming restless, captious, and even irritable
(much, it must be confessed, to the secret amusement of Mr
Thomas Randolph), Walter Maxwell felt a fresh impulse
given to that generosity, which prompted him to put an end
to-night to his anxieties and misgivings once for all.</p>

<p>The Queen, in the meantime, seeking, in her innocence
and gaiety of heart, to keep up the characteristic merriment
of the feast, was unconsciously exciting the displeasure of her
nobility, and unwittingly preparing the downfall of her versatile
little favourite&mdash;the Italian Riccio.</p>

<p>Disregarding the coarser witticisms and grotesque antics
of James Geddes, who indeed had become a duller fool day
by day, since the shock his feeble intellect sustained on the
morning of Chastelâr’s death, Mary had summoned her private
secretary into the centre of the illustrious circle which surrounded
her, and, with a familiarity exceedingly displeasing
to the haughty Scottish barons, bade him <em>improvise</em>, after
the manner of his country, for their amusement. Nothing
daunted by bent brows and scornful looks, the glib foreigner,
placing himself on a cushion at the Queen’s feet, commenced
a lively tale, of which the incidents and the language, for it
was related in French, were most displeasing to his audience.
It turned upon one of those fables so popular at
the time in Italy, and was, indeed, both in its details and its
catastrophe, especially unsuitable to the practical nature
and affected asceticism of the Scottish character at that
period.</p>

<p>‘There was a beautiful flower,’ said he, his little black eyes
twinkling at the Queen while he spoke, ‘growing in a fair
garden, through which ran a mountain stream, and the birds
of the air and the insects of the noontide came to pay their
court to this flower and to win a breath of her fragrance, for
she was the pride of all earthly plants and the queen of the
garden. So the humming-bird flitted by in his bravery, and
she marked not his liveries of blue and gold, nor bent her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
head towards him, but let him pass on to court the flowers of
his own tropical land, gorgeous without perfume, dazzling
but loveless, like a fair woman without a heart. And the
nightingale sang his life away to please her, and, wooing her
with his last notes, died hungering when the evening star
shone out above the trees. Then the butterfly brought his
painted coat and his gay manners and fluttered about her,
making sure that a courtier like himself must prevail; but
she bent not her head nor moved one of her leaves towards
him, though the breeze was sighing softly around her and
shaking the dewdrops from her stem.</p>

<p>‘None of the gay and gaudy seemed to win the favour of
that queenly flower. At length a bee came buzzing home
from his labours, laden with the honey-dew that he had been
gathering far and wide. He thought to rest on her petals and
distil fresh treasures from her chalice, but she shook her
beautiful blossoms merrily in the breeze and waved him
scornfully away.</p>

<p>‘All the birds of the air and the noontide insects marvelled
that she would have none of them, for they deemed her
haughty and unsociable, whispering to one another of the
pride that goeth before a fall.</p>

<p>‘Now, even as she shook her petals in disdain, she opened
her heart to the daylight, and at its very core lay concealed a
lazy useless drone. Then the humming-bird and the butterfly
and the bee laughed together, for they said&mdash;</p>

<p>‘“Of what avail are beauty and bravery and worth, against
possession? And if she have taken the dullest of all insects
to her heart, we have but lost our time in suing her, and the
nightingale, on the cold earth yonder, hath given his life in
vain.”</p>

<p>‘There is a moral in my fable, ladies!’ added Riccio, with
a smile and a shrug of his crooked shoulders&mdash;‘a moral that
you will all of you acknowledge if you tell truth.&mdash;Who shall
dictate to a woman’s fancy, or reduce to rule the wandering
inclinations of a woman’s heart?’</p>

<p>The ladies laughed and whispered, some protesting against
the conclusion, others pitying the poor nightingale, but all
uniting in condemnation of the useless drone.</p>

<p>Lord Ruthven, who had been eyeing the narrator with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
looks of fierce scorn, strode up to where he was sitting at the
Queen’s feet, and asked him, in a loud, contemptuous voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Were there no <span class="smcap">Wasps</span> in yonder garden of which you
spake, Master Tale-teller,&mdash;wasps that might give the drone
a lesson, and teach him his place was somewhat lower than
the bosom of its choicest flower?’</p>

<p>The Italian looked up somewhat scared in his grim questioner’s
face.</p>

<p>‘Nay, signior,’ he replied humbly, ‘in courtly gardens the
wasps must leave their stings behind.’</p>

<p>‘Aye! sticking in the carcase of the drone!’ returned
Ruthven, with a brutal laugh, which was echoed by Morton,
and one or two other savage-looking noblemen who stood near.</p>

<p>The Queen seemed highly displeased, but, true to her conciliatory
principle, hastened to change the subject ere these
turbulent spirits should further forget their own dignity and
the respect due to her presence. Calling her maidens around
her, she bade them bring her harp, a beautiful instrument,
highly ornamented, and proposed it should be the prize of any
lady in the company who could sing to it an impromptu measure
on a subject she would herself propose.</p>

<p>‘I shall play on it no more,’ said Mary, with a half-melancholy
smile. ‘It is only maiden-queens who have time for
such follies. A busier day, for aught I know, may be about
to dawn, ere long, on Mary Stuart’ (here she cast a sly glance
at Randolph, who, without seeming to heed her, was listening,
all attention), ‘and I cannot leave my favourite instrument
in better hands than hers who wins it fairly by her skill.
Behold! which of you, ladies, will undertake to strike these
strings and improvise a song, as deftly as our little secretary
here has told us a story?’</p>

<p>It was an attempt requiring considerable confidence in such
a presence. The ladies gazed on one another in obvious hesitation.
Presently a handsome, intellectual-looking woman
stepped forward, and curtseying to Her Majesty, bent gracefully,
without speaking, over the instrument.</p>

<p>‘Beatrix Gardyn!’ exclaimed the Queen, with a bright
smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> ‘the Sappho of the North! I know of none better
qualified to do justice to my poor harp; will you begin, Beatrix,
at once? Are you waiting for inspiration?’</p>

<p>‘The theme, an’t please your Majesty?’ said Beatrix, bowing
her classic head with the utmost composure, and sweeping
a masterly prelude over the strings.</p>

<p>The Queen gave another meaning glance at Randolph, and
laughed again.</p>

<p>‘What say you to my marriage, my <em>possible</em> marriage, and
the consequent release of my four bonny maidens from their
celibacy? The subject, methinks, is a noble one; and see,
the Maries are listening all attention for your strains.’</p>

<p>Beatrix Gardyn struck a few wandering chords, then with
bent brows and kindling eyes fixed on vacancy, broke into a
melody to which, with but little hesitation, and now and then
a meaning smile, she adapted the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>THE MAIDENS’ VOW.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rounds of applause followed the conclusion of the song.
The approval with which Mary received it was tantamount
to an acknowledgment of its truth; and the courtiers scarce
refrained from cheers and such noisy demonstrations of their
acquiescence in its purport.</p>

<p>Congratulations were freely tendered to the Maries on their
coming release from the vows by which it had been long understood
they were bound; and many facetious remarks were
directed at those young ladies on a topic, which although next
to death the most serious and important in the human destiny,
has been considered, from time immemorial, as a fitting subject
for stale witticisms and far-fetched jokes.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this clamour and merriment, Walter
Maxwell slipped quietly out of the presence; and when Mary
Carmichael, wondering how he would be affected by the news
that thus seemed to stir the whole Court, stole a wistful look
towards the corner he had lately occupied, behold, he was
gone!</p>

<p>After this the buzz of conversation, the rustle of ladies’
dresses, the strains of the Queen’s musicians, seemed to strike
wearily on her ear; how pointless seemed the jests that yet
provoked bursts of laughter from the bystanders; how uninteresting
the vapid compliments that were yet paid with such
an air, and received so graciously; how dull and uninteresting
the whole routine of a courtier’s life, and the individual items
that composed a courtly assemblage! As we must all do
sooner or later, for the moment the girl saw life without the
varnish, and wondered it had ever looked so bright; she
longed for the hour of dismissal, when she, too, had a tryst
to keep, a duty to perform. In the meantime we must follow
Maxwell into the Abbey garden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The foremost was an aged knight,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He wore the gray hair on his chin,</div>
<div class="verse">Says, “Yield to me thy lady bright</div>
<div class="verse indent2">An’ thou shalt walk the woods within.”</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He paused as he emerged from the palace, to let the cool
air fan his brow, and to give his thoughts and energies
time to collect themselves for the great effort he felt he had
to make. Then he walked steadily on to the well-known spot
under the apple-tree, where he remembered to have witnessed
the interview between Mary Carmichael and her mysterious
admirer. Once he had loved that spot so dearly; once he
used to linger there for hours together at night, and watch
the lights in the apartment inhabited by the Maries; once he
was fool enough to feel his heart thrill when <em>her</em> shadow crossed
the casement. Well! that was all past and gone. It seemed
strange the place could be so changed, and yet the same.</p>

<p>There is no feeling so sad as that with which we revisit our
earthly paradise, whatever it may be, after our return has been
forbidden, and the angel placed at the gate to warn us off
with his flaming sword. Adam and Eve plodded away indeed
contentedly into the wilderness, but we, their children, cannot
always resign ourselves so philosophically to the inevitable.
We plead and pray to be allowed to re-enter, and, perhaps to
enhance our punishment, the angel is suffered to give way to
our entreaties. Ah! it is the same garden still. Although
the trees are lying prostrate, dank, and rotting, on the tufted
sward; although the flowers are broken and withered and
trampled into the earth; although there are dust and ashes
now, and the darkness of desolation, where once the ripe fruit
glowed, and the green leaves flickered in the golden floods of
noon; yet it is here we first knew paradise; it is from this
spot we first caught a glimpse of the dazzling depths of heaven;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
it was from that spring, choked and tangled and dried up now,
we first drank the waters of life. All is ruined and defiled
and destroyed, but it is our Garden of Eden still. We had
rather sit here with bowed head and rent garments, than walk
the fairest realms of earth, in purple and fine linen, lord and
ruler of the whole.</p>

<p>Poor ghosts we are indeed, some of us, even while clothed
in our fleshly coverings, and prone to wander to and fro about
the spot where we buried our treasures, though they have been
dug up and taken away long ago. If we could but sever that
cord which links us with the past and cut out the moral gangrene,
as we amputate the physical limb when mortification
has set in, how healthy would be our spiritual being, how cheerfully
we could limp, mutilated but painless, to the grave!</p>

<p>Alas! to some natures it is impossible. To such the
punishment of Prometheus is no fiction. The chain and the
vulture and the rock must be their portion. Nevertheless
they are not eternal, and the Garden of Eden itself, glowing
in the summer noon, was but a dreary waste compared with
that garden which men enter by a strait way and through
a narrow gate.</p>

<p>Maxwell looked about him with a heavy heart. He was
young yet, and the lesson of life, which all must learn, came
painfully to him in the freshness of his youthful hopes.</p>

<p>It takes a long time and a good many reverses to acquire
the unenviable stoicism which always <em>expects</em> the worst and is
seldom disappointed. He was, however, consoled and supported
by the consciousness that he had come to a final
determination, unselfish and sincere, which would put an end
to his doubts once for all. Whilst the dice are yet unthrown,
it is a wondrous moral sedative, that resolution to set our
whole future on the cast. When they have come up against
us, we are by no means satisfied to abide by the issue, but
this is an after consideration, and affects not a whit the vigour
of our purpose in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>The watcher had not long to wait. A tall dark figure,
cloaked as before, was soon seen gliding to the accustomed
spot. Ere he had well reached the apple-tree, Maxwell was
already by his side, and had laid his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>The stranger started. Under his cloak a few inches of steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
showed themselves out of the scabbard, as his grasp closed
upon his sword; but he drove the blade home with a clash,
thoroughly reassured at Maxwell’s first sentence.</p>

<p>‘I am your friend,’ exclaimed the latter, hastily but in a
cautious voice, ‘at least for the present. You are in danger,
and I have come here to warn you.’</p>

<p>There was something so frank in his tones that the other
responded immediately. He even lowered the cloak in which
his face was muffled and smiled gaily as he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I am used to it, my good friend, but equally beholden to
you, nevertheless. I would fain know, all the same, who you
are that take such interest in my welfare, and wherefore.
Nay,’ he added, more abruptly, ‘this is scarcely candid. I
know <em>you</em>, Master Maxwell, and I believe you to be a man of
honour and a gentleman; but what you can have to communicate
to me is indeed a mystery.’</p>

<p>There was light enough to distinguish the speaker’s features.
They were those of a singularly handsome man in the prime
of life, as his rival did not fail to remark, with a certain defiance
and reckless good-humour in their expression. His hair and
beard were somewhat gray, but not sufficiently so to destroy
the general comeliness of his appearance, and his eyes would
have been beautiful even in a woman.</p>

<p>‘This is no time to bandy compliments,’ answered Maxwell,
still in the same low tone. ‘You are engaged here in some
intrigue; it may or it may not amount to treason. You have
been coming and going secretly for months. If you are discovered
and arrested, your very life is in danger. Is it not
so?’</p>

<p>‘Granted,’ replied the other, smoothing his gray moustache
with a provoking air of calmness. ‘There is no game without
a hazard. And what then?’</p>

<p>‘You have been watched!’ urged Maxwell, impatiently.
‘You have probably been recognised by those who know you
better than I do. Perhaps a few more hours may see you
arrested. I tell you, Randolph is on your track, that Southron
bloodhound who never over-ran a scent nor opened on a false
trail. You had better have the devil for your enemy than the
English Ambassador!’</p>

<p>‘I trust devoutly I may prevail against both,’ answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
stranger; then added musingly, ‘You say true about Randolph;
his schemes are both wide and deep, whilst his hand is as
prompt to execute as his brain is subtle to devise. I pray ye,
my friend, when did ye learn I was to be here to-night?’</p>

<p>‘This day at dinner, and from Randolph himself,’ replied
Maxwell. ‘The Minister spared not the wine-flask, I promise
you; and had it been any other man I might have believed
that he told me more than he intended, but not all the vineyards
of the Rhine or the Garonne would influence Randolph’s
tongue to play false for a syllable to Randolph’s brain. Nay,
I will deal frankly with you, fair sir. I offered myself to be
the means of unmasking you, in order that I might warn you
in time and save you from your fate!’</p>

<p>‘It was most friendly and considerate,’ observed the other,
with a laugh not far removed from a sneer. ‘I would fain
know, nevertheless, to what happy chance I am indebted for
the interest Master Walter Maxwell takes in my preservation.
Nay,’ he again broke off abruptly, and added with complete
sincerity, ‘this is unworthy of both of us. You are an honest
fellow, Master Maxwell, and a loyal gentleman. Roundly now,
what is your hidden motive for this proceeding? Come out
with it!’</p>

<p>‘My motives are honourable enough,’ replied the other, with
some difficulty retaining his composure. ‘I pray you attribute
no hidden meaning to what I have to say. Be frank and
open with me, whether friend or foe, as I swear I am frank
and open with you.’</p>

<p>‘I believe it!’ exclaimed the other, extending him his hand;
but Maxwell, without taking it, folded his arms across his
heart, and proceeded in the low quiet tones of repressed excitement&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I have no right to assume that your presence here in
silence and secrecy is for any other than a political object, and
yet from my own knowledge I am satisfied that there are
further motives of a private nature. If you feel that what I
have done for you to-night deserves any return, I claim your
confidence in a matter that is to me one of life and death.’</p>

<p>He wiped the drops from his pale face as he spoke, and the
stranger, pitying his obvious agitation, motioned to him
courteously to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>‘There is a lady of the Court,’ resumed Maxwell, still in
the same concentrated voice, ‘who has allowed herself to
hold clandestine interviews with you in this spot by night.
No man alive shall make me believe that anything but an
ardent and sincere affection would tempt that lady so far to
commit herself. Mistress Carmichael is above the weaknesses
and petty vanities of her sex. I demand of you, on your
honour as a gentleman, to clear her conduct in my eyes by
avowing that you are her lover.’</p>

<p>The stranger had started violently when he heard mentioned
the proper name of the adventurous damsel, whom in truth he
was momentarily expecting, but the lower part of his face
was again concealed in his cloak, and his whole frame was
shaking from some strongly-curbed emotion, while he demanded&mdash;</p>

<p>‘By what right do you ask so unwarrantable a question?’</p>

<p>‘By the right of a pure and holy affection,’ answered Maxwell,
gravely; ‘by the right of an unselfish love that would
even give her up ungrudgingly to a worthy rival!’</p>

<p>‘Hoity-toity, young gentleman!’ exclaimed the stranger,
breaking forth into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, all the
more violent that he dared not indulge in it above his breath.
‘Thou art not likely to lose aught for lack of asking; thou
art one of these wild Iceland falcons, I warrant me, that will
fly their pitch, hooded and jessed and all, to strike at every
quarry alike. I ought to be angry with thee, man; but I
cannot for the life of me. In faith I forgive thee; I forgive
thee were it but for the jest’s sake.’</p>

<p>He wiped his eyes while he spoke, and, turning away,
stamped upon the ground, as he held his sides once more in a
convulsion of mirth.</p>

<p>To Maxwell, with his feelings wrought up to a pitch of
Quixotic generosity, all the more exalted that it was an unusual
effort of his practical nature, such a display was
irritating in the extreme. It is bad enough to hand over the
last stiver you have in your pocket, but when the tears in the
recipient’s eyes are those of mockery rather than gratitude, it
is sufficient to cause an outbreak in the most stoical temperament.
The younger man’s brow grew dark with passion, and
he laid his hand upon his sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>‘At least,’ he exclaimed, ‘I will force a confession from you;
I came here prepared for either alternative. Had you met
me frankly and vowed your devotion to her, I would have
been your friend for life; if you mean treacherously, I am
your rival to the death.’</p>

<p>The other was still laughing.</p>

<p>‘Pooh! pooh!’ said he, carelessly, ‘you are meddling with
what concerns you not. I thank you for your warning, young
sir; and, in return, I advise you to give up the championship
of every dame who comes but with a muffler into the moonlight;
I wish you good night, Master Maxwell; I would be
alone.’</p>

<p>He waved his hand rather contemptuously and turned upon
his heel; but Maxwell, now boiling with passion, placed himself
in front of him, and drew his sword.</p>

<p>‘You part not thus,’ said he; ‘by Saint Andrew, I am
henceforth your sworn foe. Draw and take your ground if
you be a man!’</p>

<p>The other put aside the weapon with his naked hand, and
laughed once more. Maxwell’s face was white with anger, and
his eyes flashed fire. Quick as thought he struck his enemy
a smart blow across the shoulder with the flat of his sword.</p>

<p>The smile on the stranger’s countenance deepened into a
very dangerous expression.</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ said he, in a hissing whisper between his teeth, ‘a
wilful man never yet wanted woe; ye have forced me to
lug out, youngster, and it shall be to some purpose, I promise
ye.’</p>

<p>With that he placed himself on guard with an ominously
steady eye, and a hand that, as he bore against his blade,
Maxwell quickly discovered to be as skilful as his own.</p>

<p>The wicked steel twined and glittered in the moonlight.
As they warmed to their work each man grew more eager
and more deadly in the murderous game; thrust and parry,
give and take, delicate feint and desperate return, were rapidly
and breathlessly exchanged, but at the end of a few passes,
though neither had gained any advantage, Maxwell’s youth
and activity began to tell upon his elder antagonist. Already
the stranger’s brow was covered with sweat, and his breath
came quick and short as he traversed here and there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
began perceptibly to give ground. With the true instinct of a
swordsman, Maxwell pressed him vigorously when he began to
fail, and was in the act of delivering a long-meditated and particularly
fatal thrust, when he suddenly found his own blade
encumbered with a woollen plaid that had been thrown over it,
and himself at the mercy of his antagonist. Looking wildly
up, he could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw Mary Carmichael’s
pale face frowning angrily upon him, while she
clung fondly and imploringly on the stranger’s sword-arm,
effectually preventing the latter from availing himself, even
were he so minded, of the diversion she had so made.</p>

<p>Stunned and stupefied, with his mouth open and his sword
point resting on the ground, Maxwell stood like a man in a
dream. Presently his face contracted with an expression of
intense pain as he saw Mary once more enveloped in his rival’s
embrace, and heard her incoherent expressions of tenderness
and alarm.</p>

<p>The stranger was soothing her gently and lovingly as a
burst of weeping succeeded the effort she had made for his
preservation. After a while he turned to his late antagonist,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You are satisfied now, sir, I presume, and have no wish to
renew this foolish and untimely brawl.’</p>

<p>But Maxwell never heard him; with pale face and parted
lips, his eyes were still riveted on Mary Carmichael. He advanced
a step towards her, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>‘You love him, then?’ said he, quite gently; but his voice
was so changed that the stranger started and turned round,
thinking some intruder had disturbed them.</p>

<p>‘I do! I do!’ replied the girl hysterically, still hiding her
face on the breast to which she clung.</p>

<p>Maxwell smiled&mdash;such a dreary, hopeless smile! then
sheathing his sword, turned and walked slowly towards the
Palace without another word.</p>

<p>The little crooked secretary had been educated in an
atmosphere of political agitation and intrigue. To his
native Italian shrewdness David Riccio added that quickness
of perception, that power of reading men’s characters at a
glance, which can only be acquired by those who are compelled,
amidst the storms through which they guide their bark,
to watch every aspect of the horizon, to press every instrument
into their service, and take every advantage that shall enable
them to weather the gale.</p>

<p>During the Feast of the Bean, whilst the majority of the
courtiers were but intent on the merriment of the moment,
whilst ladies sipped flattery and lords quaffed wine, it had not
escaped the notice of a pair of black southern eyes that Maxwell
seemed unusually restless and unhappy; that, in spite of
his outward composure, there was something wild and defiant
in his glance: nay, that he wore the look of a man in the
right mood for a desperate undertaking&mdash;one to whom a
dangerous enterprise would appear in the light of a relief.</p>

<p>Either purposely, or by chance, Maxwell, returning giddy
and half-stupefied from the Abbey-garden, found himself confronted
in one of the galleries of the Palace by Her Majesty’s
private secretary. The revel was dying gradually out; most
of the ladies, following the example of their Sovereign, had
retired, and but a few staunch wassailers were left, collected
round the buffets and tables, at which wine was still flowing
with a lavish hospitality more regal, perhaps, than judicious.</p>

<p>The secretary (though he had to rise on tiptoe to do it)
clapped the soldier familiarly on the back.</p>

<p>‘Not to bed, Master Maxwell,’ he exclaimed in jovial tones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
‘not yet to bed, without one cup of sack to wash the night
air out of thy throat and wet the wings of sleep, as we say in
Italy, so that she cannot choose but fold them around thine
head!’</p>

<p>While he spoke he desired one of the Queen’s cellarers, who
was passing at the moment, to pour him out a measure of the
generous liquid, and the man, more than half-drunk, gladly
filled his goblet to the brim.</p>

<p>Maxwell, though in no mood for revelry, was still less disposed
for solitude. Half-stunned by the blow he had received,
he yet dreaded the moment at which he must stand face to
face, as it were, with his great sorrow, and caught eagerly at
any interval of delay as a respite from his sufferings. A
draught of the rich, generous wine seemed to restore him
somewhat to himself. Riccio, meanwhile, trolled off, in his
mellow southern voice, a few notes of an Italian drinking
song.</p>

<p>He was no mean physiologist, the little secretary, and he
saw that his man was weary and saddened, and both morally
and physically overpowered. So he gave the charm time to
work, and when his companion had emptied the cup, poured
him out another forthwith.</p>

<p>‘Master Maxwell,’ observed Riccio, as he marked the eye
of the former brightening and the colour returning to his
cheek, ‘the ladies of the Court vow you are a true knight.
Like our chevaliers of Italy, sworn before the Peacock to do
them service, you are bound to refuse no adventure in their
behalf. Is it not so?’</p>

<p>Maxwell winced a little. The subject was no pleasant one,
and he was at this moment particularly sore on that point; so
he answered in a cold, hard voice&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I have little respect for the mummeries of chivalry, Signior
Riccio. A man should do his duty, whatever it be, for
its own sake. And as for the ladies,’ he added, with a sad
smile, ‘I leave it to younger and happier men to fulfil their
wishes; if indeed they are fortunate enough to be able to find
them out.’</p>

<p>The secretary laughed gaily.</p>

<p>‘Is it so?’ he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> ‘must all men alike discover that the
little finger of a white hand is heavier than the arm of a
Douglas sheathed in steel? I thought it was a lesson only
learned by the dwarfed, the misshapen, the unsightly, like me.
But you, Master Maxwell, the handsome, the straight, and the
tall; can it be that a woman listens unmoved to such men as
you?’</p>

<p>There was no covert sarcasm, no leavening of ill-nature in
his voice&mdash;nothing but the good-humoured banter of a laughing
boon companion. And yet it may be, that even under his
jest, David Riccio was glad to learn that the prizes of life did
not fall so readily to those personal advantages which he
coveted with the longing of deformity.</p>

<p>‘Enough of this!’ replied Maxwell, interrupting him
rudely, and holding out his cup to be filled yet once more.
‘Months of Holyrood have not succeeded in making me a
courtier. I love the free open sky better than these tapestried
walls. I love the sound of a trumpet better than a woman’s
false whisper, and the shaft of a Jedwood-axe better than an
ivory fan. I can hearken to a plain tale, and accept a defiance
given in my teeth, but I have no skill in reading the thoughts
of others by the rule of contrary, and I never could understand
our Scottish proverb that averreth how “Nineteen nay-says
make half a grant.”’</p>

<p>He was still chafing under his ill-usage, and talking more
to himself than his companion.</p>

<p>The latter looked at him long and eagerly. Apparently
satisfied with his scrutiny, he patted him on the shoulder once
more.</p>

<p>‘You are young,’ he said; ‘you have life before you; you
are quick-witted, brave, and adventurous. What, man, there
are more prizes than one in the lottery! If love be a false
jade, ambition is a glorious mistress. Is it not better to sit at
the back of the stage and pull the strings than to be one of
the puppets and dance because another moves you; perhaps
a fool’s dance, with a fool’s guerdon, for your pains at the
end?’</p>

<p>Maxwell shook him off impatiently.</p>

<p>‘You speak in riddles,’ said he, ‘and I have no skill in expounding
such parables. If you have aught to say, out with
it, like a man. Midnight is already past.’</p>

<p>‘And a fresh day begun,’ added Riccio,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>‘a fresh day, a
fresh scheme, a fresh triumph. What say you, Master Maxwell,
have you stomach for an adventure? Have you a mind
to draw your riding-boots on for those silken hose, and don
corslet and head-piece on a Queen’s errand? Or are <em>you</em>, too,
under the spell that paralyses youth and strength and
manhood? Are <em>you</em>, too, bound to some slender wrist
by the jesses you dare not break, and a prisoner here at
Holyrood because the rosy-lipped jailer will not let you
go?’</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed a fierce, wild laugh, and dashed his
goblet down upon the board with an emphasis most unusual
to him. Though habitually possessed of much self-command,
for an instant the tide of his feelings surged up beyond
control.</p>

<p>‘Holyrood!’ he exclaimed, mockingly; ‘what is Holyrood
to me? One place is like another, and all are barren! Talk
not to me of jesses. Your wild-hawk soars her pitch, and
strikes her quarry, and buries beak and singles in the dripping
flesh; but, bird of the air though she be, she knows the false
from the true, and will not stoop to the lure. There is no
spell can fetter the limbs of a brave man who is determined
to be free; and be the jailer never so fair, I would not waste
a look over my shoulder at my prison-house for the sake of
the rosiest pair of lips that ever were kissed on the dawn of
St Valentine! Again, what is it you would with me, Signior
Riccio? Were it an errand to the gates of hell, I think I
have spurs that would serve me to ride there; and in good
faith,’ he added in a lower tone, ‘a man need hardly
wish to come back even thence to such a dreary world as
this.’</p>

<p>Not a whisper of his voice, not a shade on his countenance,
escaped his sharp little companion. What cared <em>he</em> how hot
the furnace were, so that it tempered the tool aright? Nay,
he was even willing to burn his own fingers a little, rather
than fail in perfecting his instrument. At heart he thought
how lucky it was that there should be men who allowed themselves
to be influenced by less rational feelings than those of
self-interest and ambition. Perhaps he felt something between
pity and ridicule for that morbid state of mind which could
forget its own advantage in anger, or pique, or sorrow. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
swarthy face, however, wore nothing more than its usual
expression of comical good-humour, as he linked his arm
in Maxwell’s, and fixing his twinkling eyes upon him,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You are more trusted than half the peers in Scotland&mdash;ay,
and more trustworthy too. Come with me to the Queen’s
chamber.’</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he led Walter out of the banqueting room
and along the dim passages, in which the lamps were now
expiring, to the foot of a winding stair, the same up which
‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ had twisted his great body under the
guidance of Mary Seton. Here the secretary paused for an
instant and listened cautiously. It was pitch-dark, and he
gave his companion a hand to guide him through the obscurity,
then opening a narrow door, and pushing aside a heavy curtain
of tapestry, ushered him into a blaze of light and the
presence of four ladies, crowded together in so small an apartment
that Maxwell actually touched the robe of one of them
while he entered, and was somewhat abashed to discover that
its wearer was no other than the Queen.</p>

<p>It was Mary’s custom, when the pageantry or duty of the
day was over, to retire to this narrow retreat and sup in the
strictest privacy, with two or three of her ladies at most. The
proportions, indeed, of the apartment would admit of no larger
party, as its area was little more than twelve feet by eight,
and of this circumscribed space, a wide chimney and a window
occupied a large share. It was here that, at a latter
period, the shrieking Riccio clung to his Queen for the protection
she strove to extend to him with all a woman’s pity,
and more than a woman’s courage; it was here that, in brutal
disregard of her majesty, her beauty, and her situation, the
high-born ruffians of the Scottish peerage butchered their
victim before her eyes, nay, clinging to the skirts of her garment,
and laid the weltering body down, within a few feet of
her, to soak with its blood the very planks of their Sovereign’s
bed-chamber.</p>

<p>But to-night all was a blaze of light and warmth and comfort.
The table, with its snowy cloth, was drawn close to the
crackling wood-fire, which sparkled and glowed again in the
cut crystals and rich plate that adorned the choice little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
repast; an odour of some rich incense, such as is burnt in
Roman Catholic churches, pervaded the apartment; and
the strings of a lute that had just been laid aside were still
vibrating from the touch of a fair and skilful hand.</p>

<p>The Queen herself, all the more lovely from the slight
languor of fatigue, sat at the supper-table with her relative
the Countess of Argyle, a lady whose flaxen locks and ruddy,
laughing face formed no bad foil to the delicate colouring
and deep, thoughtful beauty of her mistress. Mary Seton,
all coquetry, animation, and vivacity, as usual, busied herself
in arranging and disarranging everything on the table; whilst
another lady, turning away from the rest, with her head bent
low over her task, was disposing some winter flowers in a vase
with peculiar care and attention. It needed not the turn of
her full white arm and dimpled elbow, nor the curl of rich
brown hair that had escaped over her shoulder, to tell
Walter this last was his <em>hated</em> love, Mary Carmichael.</p>

<p>The Queen gave him her hand to kiss as he entered the room.</p>

<p>‘Welcome, Master Maxwell,’ said she, ‘rather to the simple
dame who has bid you visit her here, in private life, than to the
Scottish Queen at Holyrood. We have put off our royalty with
our robes. To-night we shall charge you with an errand that
affects the woman far more than the Queen; to-night you
must be less than ever our subject, more than ever our friend.
You are faithful and trustworthy, we know; and, indeed,
there are few men on whose truth a lady would offer to stake
her life,’ she added, smiling, ‘as one of mine did, not five
minutes ago, on yours.’</p>

<p>Mary Seton laughed and pretended to hide her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>Walter looked wistfully in the Queen’s face; he did
not turn his eyes towards Mary Carmichael, or see how
the white neck had turned crimson while Her Majesty
spoke.</p>

<p>‘I can trust you, Maxwell?’ added the latter after a pause,
in her frankest and most engaging manner.</p>

<p>‘To the death, Madam!’ answered he, in a tone of suppressed
emotion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> ‘I have but little merit, I know, but I am
as true as the steel I wear; I would give my life for your
Grace willingly, now, this very minute!’</p>

<p>‘I believe thee,’ said the Queen, exchanging at the same
time a rapid glance with Mary Seton; ‘I trust, however, mine
errand may be done without shedding of blood. Nevertheless,
Maxwell, it requires courage, discretion, above all, a
silent tongue and a faithful heart. Listen! My good sister
entertaineth causeless grudges against me; she will endeavour
to thwart my aim and cover the mark I shoot at; she liketh
not of marrying or giving in marriage. It may be that she
mistrusteth her own power to rule in that state,’ added Mary,
while a gleam of feminine vanity crossed her brow. ‘It may
be that Elizabeth hath more dominion over men’s heads than
their hearts; nevertheless, if she and her agents were to
suspect thee of bearing such a secret of Mary Stuart’s about
thee, they would probe for it with their daggers but they
would find it ere thou wert a dozen leagues across the Border.
Bethink thee, man, ’tis a dangerous burden; art not afraid to
carry it?’</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty is jesting with me,’ replied Maxwell, raising
his head proudly, almost angrily, ‘and I can but answer with
a jest; yes, I fear to do your bidding as I fear a good horse
when I am in haste, a cup of wine when I am thirsty, or a
down pillow when I am weary and would fain lay my head
down to rest.’</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael shot at him one glance of ineffable pride
and tenderness, then busied herself amongst the flowers deeper
than before. He could not see it; his head was turned
towards the Queen; he had not forgotten, no, he never
would forget, the embrace of that stranger in the Abbey-garden.</p>

<p>‘I knew it,’ exclaimed Her Majesty, triumphantly, ‘believe
me, I was indeed only jesting with my brave and well-tried
servant. Listen then, Walter! To-morrow you must be in
the saddle at daybreak; I reckon on your arriving at Hermitage
before nightfall.’</p>

<p>At the name of Hermitage the Queen lowered her eyes
for an instant, and looked somewhat confused ere she continued&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>‘In that stronghold you will find the Earl of Bothwell, who
has returned with no leave of mine from his well-merited
banishment in France; nevertheless, “a Queen’s face should
show grace,” and we women forgive more readily than you of
the sterner sex. You will summon him to appear before his
Sovereign in Holyrood, so shall he receive pardon for his
errors. Or stay! this were an ungracious behest to so tried a
servant for one venial offence; you shall bear him Mary
Stuart’s full and free forgiveness, and bid him, as he loves his
Queen, bid him on his loyalty and allegiance, that he speed
with all his heart and all his strength the object of your
journey.’</p>

<p>‘And that object, madam?’ inquired Maxwell, observing
that Mary paused, blushing rosy red and averting her eyes
from his face.</p>

<p>‘Is my coming marriage,’ proceeded the Queen, hastily,
whilst Lady Argyle and Mistress Seton interchanged an arch
glance and smile. ‘An alliance that I take heaven to witness,
I contemplate more for the welfare of my people than for any
foolish longings of my own weak heart. Henry Stuart is of
royal blood, no unworthy mate for the proudest princess in
Europe. Lord Darnley is a comely, gentle, and well-nurtured
youth, of whose affection any lady in the land might well be
proud. You will explain this to Bothwell; you will teach
him that Mary has made no unworthy choice; you will tell
him that she has confided in him, her old and tried servant,
because she can depend upon him more securely than on any
other lord in Scotland.’</p>

<p>‘Would it not be well, madam, to write the earl a few lines
with your own hand apprising him of your intentions?’
hazarded Maxwell, who was sufficiently a man of the world
to appreciate the delicacy of his mission; and who, in good
truth, was sufficiently familiar with the temper of his powerful
kinsman to relish not the least the delivery of the message
with which he was charged.</p>

<p>Mary, however, would not entertain such a proposition for
a moment, and hurried on with far more of agitation than the
occasion seemed to warrant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Letters may be intercepted, changed, forged, misunderstood.
Master Maxwell, you will fulfil my bidding as I
charge you, or leave it alone. I can trust you, I feel. I know
you will do justice to the fair intentions of your mistress. I
know you will not allow Bothwell to misunderstand my
motives, or my feelings&mdash;Bothwell, who has always believed
so implicitly in his Queen! Nay, for letters,’ added Mary,
with her own sweet smile softening and brightening her whole
countenance, ‘I will charge you, indeed, with this one for my
Lady of Lennox, and with this token, always subject to his
mother’s approval, to be given as an earnest of my good-will
to her son. Take them carefully, Master Maxwell. Our
warden’s strong hand will pass you safely through the thieves
that infest the Border, and when you get among the southrons,
I know you will guard them with your life. I pledge you,
my trusty messenger, to the success of your mission!’</p>

<p>While she spoke, the Queen filled out a cup of wine and
put her lips to the brim, handing him, at the same time, a
packet carefully sealed and secured with a silken thread,
which wound in and out through the folds of the missive, so
that the silk must be cut before the letter could be opened.
Also a small casket, containing a beautiful antique ring, representing
a cupid burning himself with his own torch, as a
keepsake for her future husband. The messenger received
them on his knees in token of his fidelity and obedience, and
the Queen, according to the custom of the age, bade him finish
the cup of wine in which she had recently pledged him, and
refresh himself ere he departed.</p>

<p>‘It must be a stirrup-cup, your Grace,’ said Maxwell, with
a smile; ‘I shall hope to be out of sight of Holyrood ere the
sun rises. Have I received all your Majesty’s directions?’ he
added, preparing to take his leave.</p>

<p>‘There is no such hurry for a few minutes,’ replied Mary,
graciously. ‘Do you sup with royalty every night, Master
Maxwell, that you are in such haste to be gone?’</p>

<p>But Maxwell was enduring an amount of pain to which he
would willingly put a period. To be in the same room with
Mary Carmichael, nay, so close that her very dress touched
him when she moved, and yet to feel, by her averted face, by
his own offended and aching heart, that they were completely
and irrevocably estranged, was a trial to which he had no wish
to subject himself for a longer time than he could help.</p>

<p>‘I must crave your Grace’s license to depart,’ said he; and
added, looking round with a forlorn hope that just this once
he might meet the eyes that he had resolved should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
gladden him again, ‘Have none of your ladies any commands
for merrie England or the Border?’</p>

<p>Mistress Carmichael stirred uneasily, and grew very pale,
but she neither looked at the speaker nor answered him.
Mary Seton, however, with rather a noisier laugh than
common, charged him with a message on her own part, of
which, as she said merrily, he was not to purloin nor spill any
portion by the way.</p>

<p>‘If you should chance to see that rude giant who calls himself
Lord Bothwell’s henchman,’ said that young lady, ‘tell
him from me, that I hope he has not forgotten, in his wild
glens, all the polish we had such difficulty in imparting to him
at Holyrood. Commend me to him, in sober earnest,’ added
she, demurely; ‘I would send him my love had I not the fear
of Mistress Beton before my eyes, for, in good truth, he is the
only honest man I know in Scotland, except yourself, Master
Maxwell, and you are so stern and unforgiving, that I am
quite afraid of you. If a woman loved you ever so dearly,
I think you would give her up for the slightest misunderstanding.’</p>

<p>The shaft might have been shot at random, but it pierced
home to at least two hearts in that little supper-room. For
an instant <em>his</em> eyes met <em>hers</em>, and that sad, reproachful imploring
glance haunted him afterwards for months. Then Mary
Carmichael, pale, proud, and sorrowful, turned away from him
once more to her former occupation, and Walter Maxwell,
taking a respectful leave of the Queen, was ushered by Riccio
from the presence.</p>

<p>As he sped southward through the chill air of morning,
after the few hasty preparations had been completed for his
departure, he could not but acknowledge that the world had
never seemed so dreary, that he had never felt so sick at heart
before. Perhaps it would have cheered him though, to know
that another’s sufferings were even keener than his own, lying
broad awake behind him there at Holyrood, pressing a pale
cheek against a pillow wet with tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘But had I kenn’d or I cam’ frae hame,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How thou unkind wad’st been to me,</div>
<div class="verse">I would have kept my Border-side,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In spite of all thy peers and thee.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Hood her up, Dick! The worthless haggard! Like all
her sex, I would not trust her a bow-shot out of hearing
of the whistle, out of sight of the lure. Curse her! I
should have known she was but a kestrel. By the bones of
Earl Patrick, she shall never strike quarry in Liddesdale
again!’</p>

<p>The warden was in a towering passion. His favourite
hawk, a bird that he had chosen to name ‘The Queen,’ had
not only missed the wild-fowl at which he had flown her, but
spreading her broad pinions to the wind, had sailed recklessly
away for several miles ere he could recover her, a salvage that
had only been made at considerable expenditure of patience
and horseflesh.</p>

<p>He was now standing by the side of his panting steed at
the head of one of those deep, grassy glens which give such a
pastoral character to the wilds of the Scottish Border. A
severe and exhausting gallop the warden must have had, to
judge by the condition of the bonny bay, whose heaving sides
were reeking and lathered with sweat; yet the good horse
pawed, snorted, shook himself, and got back his wind, ere the
rider recovered his temper.</p>

<p>‘Dick-o-the-Cleugh,’ too, had mercifully taken his long
body out of the saddle, and was now busy replacing hood and
jesses on the recent captive.</p>

<p>‘There’s no siccan a falcon ’twixt here and Carlisle,’ said
Dick, smoothing with no ungentle hand the neck plumage
of the refractory wild bird. ‘Whiles she’ll gang her ain
gate when she misses her stoop, and what for no? A falcon’s
but a birdie when a’s said and done, and she’s just the queen
of falcons; bonny and wilful, as a queen behoves to be!’</p>

<p>Bothwell turned angrily upon his follower. The warden’s
temper had become more violent and uncertain than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Hood her up, man, I tell thee!’ said he, with an oath or
two, ‘and fasten up my girths; it is time we were back at
Hermitage.’</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he threw himself into the saddle, and,
followed by his henchman, proceeded down the glen at a
gallop.</p>

<p>The earl was at this period of his reckless and chequered
life, perhaps more than at any other, a dissatisfied and miserable
man. After his imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle subsequent
to his brawl with the Hamiltons, an imprisonment he
felt he did not deserve, at least at the hands of the Queen, he
had returned to his fastness in Liddesdale, where he had been
obliged to remain in a state of seclusion and inaction, extremely
galling to one of his adventurous nature and ardent
temperament. Here he received no direct communication
from Mary herself, a neglect which irritated whilst it distressed
him; and he only heard of her continued displeasure through
others in whom he could place no reliance, and whose interest
he more than half suspected it was to create dissension and
mistrust between him and his Sovereign. He then went for a
short period into France, hoping, perhaps, that this self-imposed
exile might elicit a recall to Holyrood; but finding no notice
taken of his movements, and assured on all sides of the
Queen’s continued coldness, he returned to his strong Castle
of Hermitage in a maddening state of uncertainty as to the
future position he should assume. The wild borderers were
all as devoted as ever to their chief. He had at no time been
actually deprived of his office as Warden of the Marches and
Lieutenant of the Southern Border, nor had he been superseded,
was it probable that a successor could be found bold
enough to take upon him the duties of the office. Accordingly
the earl remained at Hermitage in the anomalous
position of a sovereign’s representative whilst held to be an
avowed rebel to that sovereign’s authority; in the agitating
dilemma of one who is at variance with the person to whom
he is most devoted on earth, and whom self-love forbids to
offer that reparation which pride whispers may be contemptuously
refused.</p>

<p>The warden galloped on in silence for several minutes, till
the nature of the ground and the jaded condition of his good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
horse brought him perforce to a more sedate pace. With an
impatient jerk at the bridle and a curse on the stumble that
provoked it, he relapsed into a walk, and summoning ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
to his side, proceeded to vent the remainder
of his petulance on his companion. That worthy’s good-humour,
however, was proof against all such attacks, and
Bothwell, calming down after a time, took back the favourite
falcon to his own wrist, and began to caress the bird whose
wild flight had so much aroused his wrath.</p>

<p>‘’Tis a royal pastime, in good truth, Dick,’ said he, as they
emerged from a deep, narrow glen, and beheld spread out
before them a broad expanse of moorland, patched and brown
and sombre, yet suggestive of sport and freedom, a sound
sward whereon to breathe a horse, and a soft gray winter’s
sky in which to watch the flight of a hawk. ‘I would rather
be here in the saddle than mewed up in the old keep over
yonder,’ pointing while he spoke to the square towers of Hermitage,
looming dim and grand in the distance; ‘would
rather handle any weapon than a pen, and track any slot
rather than unravel a cipher. I marvel that the Earl of Moray
can keep his chamber, as he doth, the live-long day, writing,
plotting, calculating; never a stoup of wine to cheer his heart,
never a breath of the free air of heaven to cool his brow. I’ll
wager you a hundred merks, Dick, that how long soever he
remains in my poor castle he never sets foot beyond the moat
till the stirrup cup is in his hand.’</p>

<p>‘The brock<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> likes fine to lie at earth,’ answered Dick, with
a loud laugh, ‘and I doubt there’s no a brock in Liddesdale
that’s a match for the Earl of Moray in takin’ his ain part.
But hegh! Warden, there’s a sight for sair een!’ exclaimed
the henchman, interrupting himself suddenly. ‘See to yon
canny lad ridin’ down the glen; if yon’s no Maister Maxwell,
may I never lift cattle nor plenishing more! I wad ken the
back o’ him ’mang a thousand. ’Odd, man! but ye’re welcome
to Liddesdale again.’</p>

</div>

<p>In truth, while the borderer spoke, Maxwell made his
appearance on the track that led to Hermitage, exchanging, as
soon as he spied the earl and his henchman, for a brisk hand-gallop
the more steady pace at which he had been prosecuting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
his journey. The greeting between the kinsmen was sufficiently
cordial, between ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ and the new
arrival, of the most boisterous and demonstrative nature. The
rough borderer would have been at a loss to explain to himself
why he entertained so warm a regard for Walter Maxwell.
As the three rode slowly on together towards Hermitage, the
emissary thought it a good time to broach the business which
had been entrusted to him by his sovereign.</p>

<p>Slowly pacing over the open moor, where everything
breathed peace and repose, where not a tuft of heather stirred
in the soft still air, and the call of a moor-fowl or the dull flap
of a heron’s wing alone broke the surrounding silence; where
the softened gleams of a winter sun came down in sheets
of mellowed light, and heaven above and earth below
seemed wrapped in security and content, Maxwell poured
into no inattentive ears the tale that was rousing all the
fiercest passions of our nature in the heart of one of his
listeners.</p>

<p>Bothwell, after bidding him a hearty welcome to the
border, heard him patiently and in silence, with an enforced
composure that was more ominous of subsequent evil than
would have been the wildest outbreak of that wrath which he
suppressed with such an effort. His jaded horse, indeed, felt
his rider’s thighs tightening on him like a vice as the tale proceeded,
and exerted himself gallantly to meet the unusual
pressure; but only a very close observer could have marked,
by the clenched jaw, the widened nostril, and dilated eye, that
every word was driving its sting deeper and deeper, poisoned
and festering, into the warden’s heart.</p>

<p>Once indeed when a brighter gleam of sunshine than ordinary
lighted up the moor, and the old towers of Hermitage
coming into view imparted a picturesque and even beautiful
aspect to the scene, Bothwell looked up to heaven as if in
helpless expostulation with the mocking sky, and then in one
bitter and defiant smile, took leave for ever of those nobler
and better feelings which had hitherto redeemed his character
from utter reprobation.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Maxwell urged his kinsman to
forward him at once upon his journey.</p>

<p>‘I will but break bread with you, my lord,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> ‘and
so with a fresh horse speed my way to the southward once
more; mine errand brooks no delay, and he that goes wooing
for a queen must not let the grass grow under his feet while
he is about it.’</p>

<p>‘Is her Grace indeed so hurried?’ answered Bothwell with
an evil sneer. ‘Can she not wait a matter of twenty-four
hours, more or less, for this long smooth-faced lad on whom
she has set her princely heart so wilfully? God speed the
royal wedding, say I, and good luck to the bold suitor who
would lie in a queen’s bed! Here, Dick, your horse is fresher
than mine; gallop on to the Castle and bid them prepare for
Master Maxwell’s refection; see, too, that the Lord Rothes’
men and horses be well looked to if they be come. I have
guests to-night with me at Hermitage, Walter; I pray you be
not so niggardly as to depart without a supper and a night’s
rest. It is ill travelling on the Border after nightfall, and I
will speed you on by sunrise to-morrow with the best horse
in my stable and a guard of my own men. And now that
long knave is out of ear-shot, tell me, Master Maxwell, is this
marriage but an affair of state and policy? or doth the Queen
seem to affect it for herself? Is her heart in it, think you?’</p>

<p>While he asked the question Bothwell busied himself about
the hawk on his wrist, it may be to conceal the trembling of
his lip, which extended itself even to his hands, for his strong
fingers seemed unable to take off her hood or loose the fastenings
that secured her jesses.</p>

<p>‘In faith,’ answered Maxwell honestly, ‘her Grace bade
me make no secrets with your lordship. When she spoke of
marriage her colour went and came like a village maid’s
going a-maying; I reck but little of such follies,’ he added
with a sigh, ‘but if you ask me the truth, I think, Queen
though she be, she loves him as a woman should love the
man whom she bids to share a throne.’</p>

<p>Bothwell swore such a fearful blasphemy that his companion,
whose attention had been somewhat engrossed by the
irregularities of the track, looked up astonished in his face.
The earl excused himself by vowing that his falcon had
struck her talons into his arm.</p>

<p>‘The foul-hearted haggard!’ he exclaimed, flinging the
bird violently from him into the air;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> ‘let her fly down the
wind to the Solway an’ she will! She may stoop on the
southern side ere I whistle for her; no such false kestrel shall
ever perch on wrist of mine again.’</p>

<p>The hawk soared freely up into the soft calm sky, then
spreading her wings to the breeze, sailed gallantly away to
the westward, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Maxwell was too good a sportsman not to be surprised at
such an action on the part of his host, but attributed it to
one of those outbreaks of temper in which he had heard the
earl was prone to indulge; and as they now proceeded to the
Castle at a gallop by the warden’s desire, who spurred his
tired horse with savage energy, he had no opportunity of
pursuing the subject on which they had been engaged.</p>

<p>That evening, however, there was much consternation
amongst the retainers on discovering that ‘the Queen’ was
missing from her mews; much discussion as to who should
take upon himself the perilous task of informing the chief of
his loss; much astonishment at Bothwell’s unexpected answer
to the stammering varlet who apprised him of it&mdash;</p>

<p>‘May the foul fiend fly away with every feather of her!
Never speak of her again! Go fetch me a stoup of wine.’</p>

<p>In the meantime the earl and his guest sprang from their
reeking horses at a postern-door, which admitted them
privately into the Castle of Hermitage. Already its courtyard
was filled with the retinue of the Lord Rothes, a powerful
Fifeshire baron, who had even now arrived with no inconsiderable
following, on a visit to the disgraced warden. His
men were well-armed and determined-looking, their horses
strong, swift, and of considerable value. It argued little for
the repose of the country, when lord met lord upon a peaceful
visit, with fifty or a hundred spears at his back.</p>

<p>Extorting an unwilling promise from Maxwell that he
would partake of his hospitality for one night, a concession
only made by the latter on the express agreement that relays
of horses should be sent forward immediately to enable him
to prosecute his journey with extraordinary speed on the
morrow, Bothwell placed his guest in the hands of an elderly
person, whose black velvet dress, white wand, and grave
manners, could only belong to the <i>major-domo</i>.</p>

<p>‘See my cousin well bestowed in the eastern turret,’ said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the warden, ‘and bid them serve supper without delay. Tell
Lord Rothes I will give him a welcome to my poor house the
instant I have doffed my soiled riding-gear. Bring me the
key of the wicket in the winding-stair, and tell “Dick-o’-the-Cleugh”
to have six picked men and horses ready to-morrow
at daybreak.’</p>

<p>With many grave deliberate bows the old man received the
orders of his chief, and then preceded Maxwell solemnly to
his chamber, while Bothwell, with swift irregular strides, betook
himself up a winding staircase to a chamber in a remote
tower of the Castle.</p>

<p>Knocking, but not waiting for permission to enter the
apartment, he walked hastily to a table at which a man sat
writing, who looked up on his approach. Then, with an expression
of irritation and impatience at the calm face that met
his own, Bothwell flung himself into a chair, and commenced
pulling and twisting the long moustaches that overhung his
mouth.</p>

<p>Moray, for it was the Queen’s illegitimate brother, whose
occupation the warden had interrupted, looked at his host
with his usual wary scrutinising expression, that seemed to
extract the thoughts of others, but afforded no clue to his own.
It was a handsome face, too, this mask so well adapted to
conceal the workings of a mind in which diplomacy stifled
every instinct of manhood, every chivalrous spark of honour,
loyalty, and good faith. The bright fair complexion, the
regular features, the keen gray eyes, deep-set, and glittering
with scornful humour, forcibly repressed, the thin closed lips,
shutting in, as it were, upon an ill-omened smile, and the
broad square chin, denoted rather the daring schemer than
the dashing soldier, the wary politician to whom, so as it led
at last to his object, the path was none the less welcome for
being devious, rather than the stout-hearted champion who
would break his own way for himself through every obstacle,
with his own right hand.</p>

<p>Gravely and plainly dressed, though in a rich suit of sad-coloured
velvet, adorned with costly pearls, the figure that
supported this inscrutable face was formed in fair and graceful
proportions. The manners of the man were those of an
accomplished courtier, dashed with something of that stealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
gravity which marks the Romish priest; yet Moray was now
of the strictest amongst the Reformers.</p>

<p>‘A shining light,’ so said the followers of John Knox, ‘an
advanced disciple and assured professor of the true faith!’</p>

<p>‘Mine host appears disturbed,’ said Moray, in the low impressive
tone which acted as a sedative on all who came within
its influence. ‘What ails ye, my Lord Earl? Hath your
falcon flown so high a pitch she will perch on your wrist no
more? or have our friends on the southern side so far forgotten
themselves as to drive a raid across the Border? I
think we have influence with the English Queen for “heading
and hanging” at Carlisle as promptly as at Jedburgh!’</p>

<p>Bothwell winced. Hating the intrigues in which he found
himself involved; balancing, as it were, on the verge of a
precipice to which his passions hurried him, and from which
his better nature held him back, he loathed in his heart the
master-spirit that he was yet fain to obey. The demon was
under the spell of the magician, but his submission was as
unwilling as it was complete. He burst out angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>‘See to what your schemes and your intrigues have led at
last! Is this the upshot of my Lord of Moray’s plotting and
counter-plotting, and Randolph’s promises, and Maitland’s
crabbed ciphers? Faith! a couple of hundred spears and a
closed horse-litter would have done the work long ago far
better than all your bonds and all your treaties. And now it
is too late. The noblest Queen in Europe, the fairest woman
on earth, is to be wasted on a half-witted boy, a beardless
minion of the English Court. Out upon you, Earl Moray!
I have worn steel since I was twelve years old, and man hath
never so deceived me yet. Again I cry shame on you!
Answer me how you will!’</p>

<p>If Moray was startled at the intelligence or angered at
the manner in which it was conveyed, neither sensation was
suffered to betray itself for an instant. He smiled pleasantly
on his chafing companion, and answered composedly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘All’s not lost that’s in hazard. Surely no lord in Scotland
knows this better than the warden of the marshes.
Tell me the worst intelligence you have gained, and how you
learned it.’</p>

<p>Moray’s brow grew darker and darker as his host detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to him, not without violent gestures and many a wrathful expletive,
all he had gathered from Maxwell concerning the
Queen’s proposed marriage. Whether new to him or not, the
intelligence seemed to give him great concern, and once, although
it was now twilight, he turned his face from the window
so as to conceal its expression from his dupe. When Bothwell
had finished his story there was a dead silence for a few
minutes. He had lashed himself into a violent passion; he
was now calming down into a sullen despair. Moray’s face,
on the contrary, wore a brighter look after he had ruminated
a while, but his voice was as cold and distinct as ever when
he spoke again.</p>

<p>‘And the messenger is here, you say&mdash;here, in this very
castle. Lord Bothwell, if we gain time, we can place the
pieces on the chess-board for ourselves. Your borders here
are not without their disadvantages. ’Tis bad travelling for
single horsemen; they may be robbed of letters and even
jewels. Nay, if they make much resistance they are sometimes
heard of no more. ’Tis a numerous family, the Maxwells,
and a loyal. One more or less makes no such great
odds.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, nay, he is my kinsman,’ urged Bothwell, who perfectly
understood the dark suggestion of his guest, but to
whose frank and ardent nature such counsels were most distasteful.
‘Besides, she trusted me; she trusted me. My
Queen’s own words were, that “she could depend upon me
more securely than on any lord in Scotland.”’</p>

<p>‘You best know the value of the stake you play for,’
answered Moray, with a very sinister smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> ‘and the amount
you are willing to set against it. Master Maxwell is a trusty
messenger, no doubt, and will do his part faithfully, an’ he
get not his throat cut ere he reach Carlisle. Should this
marriage ever take place, it will be prudent, Lord Bothwell,
for you to make early court to young Henry Stuart. He has
a noble future before him in truth. The crown-matrimonial
of one kingdom; the crown in reversion of another; a Catholic
alliance, or I am much deceived, with France, Spain, and
Austria; lastly, no small temptation, Lord Earl, to young
blood, Her Grace, my sister, the fairest woman in Europe, for a
bed-fellow. In good faith the prize is worth struggling for!’</p>

<p>The arm of the chair which Bothwell held broke short off
in his hand.</p>

<p>‘Enough!’ he exclaimed, ‘it shall never be. What! am
I not warden here? Have I not power of life and death on
the marches? But no blood shall be shed; no blood, Moray.
Can we not bestow him in safe keeping? Counsel me, my
lord, for I am at my wits’ end.’</p>

<p>Moray laughed outright.</p>

<p>‘I will tell you a story,’ said he, whilst he shuffled his
papers together and tied them up, preparatory to changing his
dress for supper. ‘When we were studying at college in
France, my brothers and I had great dread that the prize
would be carried off by one of our companions who had more
book-learning than all the rest of us put together; well, we
invited the clever youth to an entertainment, and we drenched
his brains with wine&mdash;just such a red generous Bordeaux as
I saw a runlet of pierced only yester even here in the buttery&mdash;then
we tied him on a horse, a sorry French nag enough,
but able to carry him some ten leagues away into the country,
where we left him to sleep off his carouse. When he returned
next day the examinations were over, and I myself, for as dull
as you may think me, had taken the first prize. All is
fair in love and war, my lord. The curfew is already ringing;
it is time for both of us to meet Rothes at the supper-table.’</p>

<p>The hint was not thrown away upon Bothwell.</p>

<p>‘I will bestow him securely,’ said he, as a bright idea
seemed to flash across him; and he too departed hastily to
make preparations for meeting his guests at supper.</p>

<p>Contrary to the usual custom of Hermitage, this meal, instead
of being served in the great hall and shared with Bothwell’s
jackmen and retainers, was brought into a smaller
apartment furnished with extreme splendour, and as near an
approach to luxury as the times and locality permitted. This
was perhaps done as a compliment to the presence of Moray,
who was already beginning to accustom the nobility to his
assumptions, and while he treated them with the outward
cordiality of an equal, to cozen them insensibly of the attentions
due to a superior.</p>

<p>The dishes were served with great pomp by the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
<i>major-domo</i> and two staid attendants splendidly dressed; the
Lord Rothes, a dark handsome man, with a sinister expression
of countenance, sat on the left hand of his host, Maxwell faced
the latter, and the Queen’s half-brother was in the place of
honour on his right; also Moray’s chair was somewhat higher
than those of his companions, and of a different form.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, the wine, according to custom,
circulated freely; whatever designs might be lurking in the
breasts of the four men, the conversation was merry and
jovial enough, embracing the usual topics of hawk and hound
and horseflesh, with a good-humoured gibe or two at the
opposite sex, and a free criticism of their charms.</p>

<p>Maxwell might be pondering on the difficulties of his task;
Moray weaving additional meshes in that web which entangled
himself at last; Rothes reflecting on his frailties or his debts
his past follies or his coming embarrassments; and Bothwell
eating his own heart in combined pique, disappointment, and
vexation; but each man filled his cup, and pushed round the
flask, and passed his frank opinion or his loud jest, with a
merry voice, an open brow, and a cordial smile upon his face.</p>

<p>When the wine began to take effect, Maxwell excused himself
from further participation in the carouse, and asked permission
to retire on the plea of his early departure in the
morning. After a faint resistance exacted by the laws of
hospitality, Bothwell acceded freely to his request; meditating,
as he did, a foul treachery against him, the earl felt his
cousin’s absence would be a relief. Moray, indeed, would
have had small hesitation in so spicing his wine that he would
need a sleeping-draught no more, and few scruples would have
deterred Rothes from ridding himself of a troublesome guest
with six inches of cold steel; but the lord warden had still some
rough soldier-like notions of fair play about him, and had not
lost all at once every trace of the chivalry and manhood that
had made him heretofore the stoutest champion of his Queen.</p>

<p>When Maxwell had retired, his host sat moodily for a while,
wrapped in meditation, drinking cup after cup in gloomy
silence, and playing ominously with the haft of his dudgeon-dagger,
a weapon that was never for an instant laid aside.</p>

<p>Moray seemed to divine his thoughts. After a few whispered
words to Rothes, who treated the whole affair as an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
jest, he observed in a cold measured voice, and as if continuing
the thread of a conversation in which they had already been
engaged.</p>

<p>‘You cannot so prudently bestow him here, my lord, though
it were a good jest to keep a queen’s ambassador mewed up in
a queen’s fortress, and the prisoner would be well lodged with
his affectionate kinsman.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ demanded Bothwell, rather fiercely. ‘The
walls of Hermitage are pretty strong, my lord, and these riders
of mine are held to have a somewhat close grip when once
they lay hold.’</p>

<p>‘Nevertheless,’ argued the other, ‘this would be the first
place suspected. Nay, it might be well that you should even
deliver up the Castle to Her Majesty with a clean breast. I
have thought more than once of urging you to demand an
audience at Holyrood, to resign your lieutenancy or obtain a
just acknowledgment of your loyalty from my royal sister.’</p>

<p>Bothwell’s face brightened.</p>

<p>‘True!’ he exclaimed, dashing his heavy hand on the board.
‘We must have no stolen horse in the stall when the ransom
is told down! A clean breast and a “toom-byre,”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> as we
say here on the Border. I must send him elsewhere.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> An empty cow-house.</p>

</div>

<p>Rothes filled his cup, with a laugh.</p>

<p>‘I can lodge him at Leslie,’ said he; ‘any kinsman of Lord
Bothwell’s is welcome in my poor house. “Food and wine he
shall not lack,” as the old song says; ay, and a bed too, my
lord, if so you will it, that shall serve him till doomsday.’</p>

<p>Bothwell flushed dark red with wrath and shame.</p>

<p>‘Not a hair of his head must be jeopardied!’ he exclaimed
passionately; then controlling himself, added in a more friendly
tone, ‘I am beholden to you, Leslie, nor will I forget your
courtesy. I shall, indeed, commit my kinsman to your care
for a brief space. Four of my knaves, commanded by one
whom I can trust, shall convoy him to-morrow into Fifeshire;
though its lord is here with so gallant a following, Leslie
House is, doubtless, not left ungarrisoned.’</p>

<p>‘Trust me for that!’ answered Rothes, an evil sneer again
marring the beauty of his countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> ‘They are peaceful
knaves enough, the men of Fife, yet they would like well to
harry the old corbie’s nest up yonder, and clear off scores for
a few of Norman’s doings, to say nothing of my own. It will
be long, though, ere they crack the stones of my poor fortalice
with their teeth, and I care not to ride in Fife without some
fifty spears at my back; there are more than as many there
even now. Hark ye, Bothwell, take my signet-ring here; give
it to your lieutenant, and he will find himself at Leslie House
“master and more.”’</p>

<p>Moray, pretending not to listen, now asked for more wine
with a great assumption of joviality and recklessness. A close
observer, though, might have remarked that he scarce touched
his own cup with his lips, whilst he encouraged his companions,
who indeed were nothing loth, to empty theirs again and again.
Artfully leading the conversation to the Queen’s possible
marriage, to her different suitors, and other topics connected
with Mary, he watched Bothwell writhing under the torture,
and drowning his sufferings in revelry, with covert interest
tinged by a sardonic amusement.</p>

<p>It was midnight ere the reckless orgie broke up, when
Moray, calm, cool, and smiling, bade his companions a placid
‘good night;’ while Rothes, flushed and boisterous, trolled
off a ribald drinking-song; and Bothwell, in whom wine had
been powerless to drown the stings of conscience, sought his
solitary chamber with keen remorse and torturing self-reproach
gnawing at his heart.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Heated with wine, stung with jealousy, torn by conflicting
feelings, Earl Bothwell paced the stone-floor of his
bed-chamber, as a wild beast traverses to and fro between the
sides of his cage. His step had the same noiseless elasticity,
his air the same subdued ferocity, his eye the same lurid
sparkle that seems struck from some quenchless fire within.
If there are indeed hours at which the master-fiend is permitted
to vex those human souls, who, for some wise purpose,
are delivered like Job into his hand, the Lord Warden must
have been that night a prey to the arch-enemy of our race.
It needed but little addition to the frenzy of his mood to imagine
a dusky shape, defining itself more and more distinctly
in the gloom, stepping as he stepped, turning as he turned,
whispering in his ear suggestions that curdled his very blood,
while he pondered them, and yet were tinged with the strange
fascination which all frantic expedients possess for despair.
It takes a long apprenticeship to sorrow ere a man can bow
his head in resignation and cease to struggle, nay, even to
quiver under the lash: but he who has gained this faculty at
the cost of anguished moments, none but himself and one
besides can count, is indeed master of his fate.</p>

<p>Such, however, was far from the condition of the tameless
border-lord. He could have fought, struggled, died with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
fiercest champion that ever set his teeth in the grim smile of a
death-grapple; but the Hepburn blood was not the stuff of
which martyrs are made, and the fiercest scion of all the bold,
bad men that constituted the pride of his line, was now, so to
speak, like some demoniac of antiquity, wrestling and striving
against himself, torn, and rent, and infuriated by the possessing
spirit, which refused to be exorcised and come out of him.
That night in his lonely room at Hermitage, Bothwell learnt
many new and strange things, never to be forgotten whilst he
had life. Depths of guilt, into which, heretofore, he would
not have dared to look, were now opened up to him, and
there was seduction in the very immensity of the abyss.
Crimes, dazzling from their boldness, now seemed feasible,
nay, almost justifiable, and entranced him by the reckless daring
with which they must be carried out. He had been dreaming
hitherto a soft sweet dream for years. He was awake now,
broad awake, and the vision should become reality, or he
would never dream again. He had been cozened long enough!
What? The game was not yet played out. Turn and turn
about, fair dame! And it was Bothwell’s turn now! He
laughed a low hissing laugh within his beard, and then
stopped, startling in his walk, for it seemed to him that the
laugh was echoed by something in the room, and that the
shape was close to his ear now, whispering, whispering, one
continuous stream of upbraiding, and persuasion, and reproach,
with maddening promise and stinging sarcasm, and here and
there a devilish scoff.</p>

<p>But these paroxysms wear themselves out. By degrees the
earl became calmer; by degrees he recalled the past and reviewed
the present, and looked steadily on the future. The
whirl of contending passions passed away to make room for a
stern and gloomy resolve far more dangerous, and the molten
stream of thought that had seared his brain, cooled down into
the settled determination of the man.</p>

<p>There are seasons when the whole of our past lives seems
presented to us as on a stage, each scene distinct and vivid as
when it actually took place. Men are taught to believe that
this occurs at the supreme moment ere the spirit leaves its
dwelling, and when the heart clings so instinctively and so
pitifully to its treasure <em>here</em>. Be this how it may, there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
be no doubt that at periods of strong excitement, this <i>clairvoyance</i>,
if we may so call it, acquires extraordinary power.
For a moment it seemed to Bothwell that the gloomy walls of
his chamber had disappeared, and he stood again beneath the
sunny skies of France. Again the towers of Joinville started
from the smiling plain, and he knelt once more to tender his
homage to the fair widowed bride, who looked so sweetly
down upon him, with her pleading womanly beauty, softening
and enhancing the majesty of a Queen. It was the first
time he had ever looked on that face, which, despite of all his
madness, all his crimes, was imprinted thenceforth on his rebellious
heart. He had seen it since in sorrow, in triumph, in
levity, nay, in bitter anger and unjust displeasure against
himself, but it was still the same face to him, the type of all
that was pure and good and lovely upon earth, the charm that
had wound itself into his whole being, that shed its magic
glow over every scene and action of his life; whether he laid
spear in rest, or flung his hawk aloft in air, or watched the
last rays of sunset gilding the broad brown moor on a peaceful
summer’s evening, still that face was ever present to him,
with its quiet thoughtful beauty, and the kind look in its deep
winning eyes; then he thought of the many, many times when
he had vowed in his heart to cherish undying love and loyalty
for her alone, to ask no happier fate than to suffer shame and
sorrow for his Queen. Would he not have given his life-blood
for her, oh! so gladly that morning at Holyrood, when
he alone of all her nobles had grieved with her on her day of
grief, when, overcome by his faithful sympathy, and stung by
the cold ingratitude of the rest, she had turned her face away
and wept? And was he so changed now that he could be
plotting treason against his sovereign and violence towards his
love? For a moment his better nature mastered him; the
fierce set features writhed, the strong frame shook, and though
he was alone in the room, in the hush of midnight, the proud
noble bowed his head and turned his face aside, ere he dashed
away the drops that had stolen unawares to his shaggy eyelashes.</p>

<p>But the devil was watching his opportunity, and what a
picture did he now conjure up! The beautiful Queen in her
robes of ceremony, with the crown upon her head and the orb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and sceptre in her hands; ambassadors from England, France,
Spain, Austria, thronging with their sovereigns’ congratulations;
the nobility of Scotland proffering homage before the
throne; and these regal honours shared by a tall handsome
stripling, who would lift his lady-face scornfully, and stretch
a weak girlish hand for <em>him</em>, Bothwell, to kiss! Worse than
all, amongst the courtiers’ jeering faces, Moray’s cool sardonic
smile, as of one who had foreseen the degradation from which,
had his advice been taken, it would have been so easy to
escape. And then the banquet and the wedded pair, sitting
side by side, and the subsequent revel and the customary
ceremonies, and the laughing guests departing one by one,&mdash;and
then, and then,&mdash;the stillness of night brooding over the
old pile of Holyrood, and Mary once more a bride, another’s
bride, and Bothwell a laughing-stock!</p>

<p>‘Perdition! it shall never be!’ exclaimed the earl, dashing
down, while he spoke, with the violence of his involuntary
gesture, the lamp that stood on the table by his side. The
few moments consumed in rekindling it gave him time to
compose himself, and to determine on his future conduct. It
was but a brief period, yet was it long enough for Bothwell
to bid farewell, at once and for ever, to all the higher and
purer feelings of his nature; to change him from a man who,
with many faults and with ungovernable passions, yet
possessed a certain frank uprightness, a certain chivalrous
devotion to the one idol of his life, into an unscrupulous
ruffian, prepared to commit any crimes, to go any lengths in
the prosecution of his schemes, and willing in brutal selfishness
to drag his idol down to the dust, rather than see it
enshrined upon the pedestal of another. One moment cannot
indeed change the whole character of a human being, though
it may influence his whole conduct; but as it is the last ounce
that breaks the patient camel’s back, so is it the one additional
atom of sorrow, or unkindness, or disappointment, added to
the mass, that overwhelms the poor sufferer’s powers of endurance,
and drives him into the frenzy of despair, or leaves
him stunned and sick at heart, in the helpless apathy of a
ruined man. It would be well to think of this sometimes
when we see the bruised reed so nearly broken, the kind
generous nature so wearied and suffering and overladen. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
is but an ignoble triumph to lend the tottering mass that
slight push which sends it crashing to destruction. It is
cowardly and un-English to ‘strike a man when he is
down.’</p>

<p>Bothwell lit his lamp, and wrapping a furred bed-gown
around him whilst he thrust his feet into the <i>mules</i> or slippers
which would best muffle their tread, proceeded with swift and
stealthy strides along the passages of his Castle, towards the
eastern turret in which his kinsman was disposed. All was
hushed and silent within the walls of Hermitage. The drowsy
sentinels might have been sleeping on their posts, for neither
stir of arms nor measured tread of steel-shod foot denoted
their vigilance, yet, strange to say, the warden failed to
observe this unusual silence. Nevertheless, preoccupied as
he was, he marked a light still burning in Moray’s chamber,
and instinctively he shaded the lamp he carried with his hand
when he passed the narrow casements on the opposite side of
the Castle-yard. Arrived at Maxwell’s door, he listened for
a while, and satisfied himself by the deep breathing within
that his kinsman was asleep; then shading his light once
more, he entered the room softly, and made at once for the
small travelling valise, in which he hoped to find the messenger
had secured his despatches. But Maxwell had travelled
the Borders ere this, and had profited by his experience.
Ready dressed, booted and spurred, with his sword by his
side, he lay prepared for a start, sleeping indeed, yet not so
sound but that a sudden noise might waken him. Whatever
he had about him of value was concealed in his breast, and
could not be taken from him without disturbing his repose.
Bothwell felt once for the haft of his dagger, and smiled
grimly to himself, as he thought how easily he might possess
himself of his guest’s despatches, and how lightly he would
think <em>now</em> of such a crime as murder under his own roof.
There was even a wild devilish triumph in the reflection that
he could have so changed within an hour!</p>

<p>After a moment’s thought, however, he again passed unobserved
from the room, and returned to his own as stealthily
as he had come. There he spent the remainder of the night,
still pacing up and down, up and down, and an hour before
dawn summoned ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ already astir thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
early, to a long and mysterious consultation, in which, though
he yielded eventually, for the first time in his life the retainer
presumed to remonstrate with his lord.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Oh, they rade on, and farther on,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And they waded through rivers above the knee,</div>
<div class="verse">And they saw neither the sun nor the moon,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But they heard the roaring of the sea.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The morning broke gloomily. A thick and heavy mist
clung around the towers of Hermitage, dimming the
arms and saturating the cloaks of the escort already mounted
and waiting in the Castle-yard. The moisture dripped from
the ears and nostrils of the horses, and stood upon the beards
of their riders, while the former stamped and shook their bits
impatiently, and the latter muttered a coarse jest or two, not
without fervent aspirations after a tass of brandy to keep the
raw air from their throats.</p>

<p>Presently ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ emerged from the turret
containing the warden’s private apartments, wearing an
unusually gloomy expression on his face, and proceeded
to examine the arms and appointments of his comrades,
with a disposition to find fault, that elicited sundry growls,
murmurs, and a round oath or two from the impatient jackmen.</p>

<p>There was, however, but little delay, in starting the cavalcade.
Maxwell, who had been anxiously awaiting the spare
horse prepared for him, was soon in the saddle exchanging a
cheerful greeting with the troopers, to which Dick alone made
no reply; and while it was yet scarcely light, the portcullis
was raised, and the party filed out, intently watched from one
of the narrow windows by a haggard eager face, that still
looked and lingered after the croup of the last horseman had
disappeared. Bothwell even made one hasty gesture, as if to
recall his mandate, and order the party back, but changing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
mind again on the instant, with a bitter laugh, he took a long
draught from a wine-flagon that stood by his bed-side, and
then flinging himself on the couch, turned doggedly to the
wall and tried to force his senses into sleep.</p>

<p>Maxwell felt his sovereign’s letter lying safe within his
doublet. He examined, too, the priming of his pistols, and
turned his sword-belt a little more to the front. Then he
proved the mouth and mettle of his charger with rein and spur,
deriving from the experiment all the confidence felt by a
good horseman on a well-bitted steed. Satisfied at length on
these important points, his spirits rose with the morning air
and the excitement of his mission. Even Mary Carmichael’s
falsehood seemed less black in hue than it appeared yesterday.
The future once more showed promise of something beside a
dull apathetic response to the call of duty alone. He looked
along its dim vistas, and saw the light shining, though faintly,
at a distance. The mission was already in imagination half-fulfilled.
He had made his journey prosperously through the
rich districts of middle England, and gained the capital with
unprecedented rapidity, thanks to good luck in procuring
horses, and his own untiring powers in the saddle. He had
delivered his credentials to Lady Lennox, and presented himself
at Greenwich Palace to the Maiden Queen. He could
even conjure up a picture in his mind of that redoubtable lady;
could imagine the flaxen curls, the stately figure, the harsh
yet not uncomely features, and the dignified gestures that
veiled a woman’s vanity beneath the majestic bearing of a
British sovereign. He became a courtier for the occasion,
and thought how he could serve his own dear mistress with a
well-timed compliment, and a little apt flattery to her rival
‘Good Sister.’ He saw himself dismissed with honour, and
speeding back to the North, triumphant at the safe accomplishment
of his mission. Then he fell to thinking of Mary’s
kindly thanks, delivered with all that charm of manner which
made a word from her better than a jewel from another, and
his welcome reception at Holyrood by all the loyal and well-disposed
party to whom it was of no small moment to see
their Queen happily married.</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>others</em>, thought Maxwell, might not have served her
so well. Perhaps <em>one</em> of her maidens, with whom, as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
rest, loyalty was still the master passion, might be inclined to
give him a welcome far warmer and kinder than her proud
and distant farewell: might think she had judged him harshly,
prematurely: might wish when it was too late that she had
not so scornfully rejected his devotion, nay, might long to
possess now what she had valued so lightly when it was her
own. Then he would teach her a lesson that it would do her
good to learn; then how delicious would be the triumph of
meeting her coldly, politely, with calm friendship and quiet
good-will, far more cutting than any amount of assumed indifference
and unconcern; then she would know that she had
altered her mind too late, that a man of energy and action was
not to be pulled hither and thither like a puppet by the weak
hand of a woman holding the string; that she had flung the
falcon from her wrist once, jesses and all, and he would soar
his wing now, and never stoop to lure of hers again.</p>

<p>Oh! it would be a happy moment; and yet how much
happier to forgive her freely, and without reproach to take her
hand in his, look frankly in her face, and tell her he had loved
her all along, even when she was most wilful and most unkind!
Was he not a man&mdash;a bold strong man? What had he to do
with pride as regarded her? Nay, was it not his pride to
think that whilst he yielded an inch to no one else on earth,
he would always be content to accept suffering, sorrow, even
humiliation, for her dear sake?</p>

<p>Such is the usual conclusion of one of those love reveries in
which men indulge whilst under the influence of the malady;
such is the climax of an infinity of stem resolution and haughty
self-reproach and bitter self-examination; we make ourselves
very unkind and very uncomfortable, and after all leave off
very much at the point from which we started, if anything, in
a less rational frame of mind than at first.</p>

<p>Maxwell could not but compare himself at the moment to
the horse of one of the leading files of his escort, which had
got bogged up to the girths in a <i>well-head</i>, as those particularly
soft pieces of morass are called, which abound on the Scottish
moorland. The poor animal made two or three gallant efforts
to extricate itself, stimulated not only by the great terror a
horse entertains of such a catastrophe, but by a fierce application
of its long-legged rider’s spurs; each plunge only hampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
it more irrevocably, and at last amidst the loud jeers of his
comrades and a volley of oaths from himself, the trooper
abandoned the saddle and wisely allowed the beast to be still
for a few moments and recover its wind.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s attention, which had hitherto been somewhat
taken up with his own thoughts, was now directed towards
the locality in which he found himself, and the mist clearing
away as the day drew on, enabled him to recognise one or two
of those acclivities and breaks of the sky-line which constitute
the landmarks of an open moorland district, such as he was at
present traversing.</p>

<p>Though he had been but once before at Hermitage, his
soldier’s eye had not failed to acquaint itself with the general
outline of the surrounding country. He now recognised a
conical-shaped hill on his left hand, that he distinctly remembered
to have passed yesterday in riding from Edinburgh on
his right; the wind, too, which from the appearance of the
weather he judged to be easterly, struck cold upon his right
cheek; he was convinced they must be going north. His first
impression was that the party had lost its way in the mist; his
first impulse to jeer its leader, his old friend Dick, on such a
want of moss-trooping sagacity.</p>

<p>‘How now, master Dick?’ said Maxwell, cheerily, looking
round for his friend, who rode silent and sullen in the rear;
‘I should have thought you knew your way to the southern
side better than this! If you wanted to drive Lord Scrope’s
horses, or empty a byre or two in Cumberland, you wouldn’t
take the road to Holyrood, as I am much mistaken if we are
not doing, this morning. Why, man, I came by that very
cairn on the green hill yesterday. Thou must be asleep,
Dick, for I know the ale is not yet brewed that will make
thee drunk!’</p>

<p>Dick shook himself sulkily in reply, and moving his horse
alongside his questioner, laid his hand on the other’s bridle-rein
as if to guide him into a sounder path.</p>

<p>‘I’m thinkin’, Maister Maxwell,’ said Dick, with an assumption
of extreme friendliness and great caution, ‘that it
wud be mair wise-like just to whig cannily back to Holyrood,
and leave a fule to gang a fule’s errand for himself.’</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed good-humouredly. Even now he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
persuaded the borderer had missed the southern tract, and
was annoyed at his own stupidity, perhaps inclined to veil it
from his men by affecting ignorance of his charge’s destination.</p>

<p>‘Holyrood is a fair palace, Dick,’ said he, ‘and I left it
but yesterday at daybreak. Do you think I came all the way
to Hermitage only to push the wine-cup round with wild Lord
Rothes, and so back again, with red eyes and a singing brain,
to my duties in the Queen’s ante-room? Nay, nay, the sooner
we strike the right track and cross the Border the better. Why,
man, I should be half-way to York before sun-down!’</p>

<p>Dick seemed sadly disturbed. He fidgeted with his bridle,
he loosened his sword in its sheath, he looked up and down
and on all sides of him in obvious vexation. Once when a
jackman rode nearer Maxwell than was convenient, he bade
the man keep his distance with a hearty curse. He seemed
hurried, and yet anxious to put off time, and talked at random
as one does who has some engrossing subject of no pleasant
nature to occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p>‘Ye wad be better at Holyrood, Maister Maxwell,’ said he,
still harping on the old subject. ‘An’ ye were at the palace
yesterday, nae doot, wi’ the Queen an’ her leddies, an’ who
but you? I wish ye were there at this moment, Maister
Maxwell, an’ that’s the dooms truth o’ it!’</p>

<p>‘Orders must be obeyed, Dick,’ answered the other, vainly
trying to induce the whole cavalcade to increase their pace,
which had now dwindled down to a very funeral walk. ‘That
reminds me, I have a message for you from one of the Queen’s
maids-of-honour.’</p>

<p>All the blood in the borderer’s great body seemed to rush
into as much of his face as was visible beneath his morion,
then the colour faded visibly, and for the first time in his life
‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ turned as white as a sheet.</p>

<p>‘It wad no be from Mistress Seton!’ said he, almost unconsciously,
and with the true Scottish negative that affirms so
much. ‘Man! I wad like fine to hear it,’ and he bent over
his horse’s neck and looked Walter in the face with something
of the wistful eager expression that the Newfoundland dog,
to whom he has already been compared, assumes when his
master is going to throw a stick for him to retrieve out of the
water. In the animal goes! A plumper off the pier, be it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
never so high, and the waves breaking never so angrily below,
and you may be sure that in his noble instinct of fidelity he
would drown ten times over before he would let go.</p>

<p>Walter freed his rein from the other’s grasp, and struck
into a trot.</p>

<p>‘It was but to hope you had not forgotten all she taught
you, Dick, good manners and such like. I may tell her when
I see her again that you are such a courteous squire now, you
guide the bridle-rein of a mounted man-at-arms as carefully
as a lady’s palfrey. Tush, man! we are wasting time; let us
strike into the right path and get on. I tell thee mine errand
admits of no delay!’</p>

<p>He spoke impatiently, but yet in perfect good-humour, and
looking on his companion’s face, was startled at the expression
of intense pain that was apparent in its features. ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
looked like a man who had been shot through
the body, and was endeavouring to hide his internal agony
under an appearance of outward composure.</p>

<p>Inside that stalwart frame of his a terrible conflict was
going on. Good feeling, manhood, a certain reflective sense
of the duties of hospitality, above all, loyalty to the Queen,
represented by an intense devotion to one of her maids-of-honour;
all these sentiments were at war with the habits of
a lifetime and the first feudal instinct of the henchman&mdash;implicit
obedience to his chief. It is needless to say that the
latter obtained the mastery.</p>

<p>Maxwell was a friend, and he had come from the immediate
presence of her who was the one bright image that
gladdened the man’s honest unsophisticated heart, that
elevated his rude nature and gave him a glimpse of something
better than clash of steel and clang of drinking cups, the excitement
of a foray, and the pleasures of a debauch; but, on
the other hand, Bothwell was the master whom he had
venerated and obeyed from childhood; whose mandate it
never occurred to him to dispute; whose will was law. The
Rutherfords had served the Hepburns by flood and field as
long as either family could count their line. It was not for Dick,
so he thought, to be the first traitor of his race; yet he loathed
his task, too, this frank-hearted borderer, and his face was very
stern and his voice rung hoarse and harsh when he spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ye say true, Maister Maxwell. Orders <em>must</em> be obeyed,
Gude forgi’e us! and <em>the Laird’s bidding must be done</em>!’</p>

<p>Startled by the altered tone, Maxwell turned in his saddle,
and at the same instant a thick woollen plaid, thrown over
him from behind, was drawn tight across his head and face,
a sword-belt was as quickly strapped round his arms above
the elbows, a stout moss-trooper pinioned him on either side,
two more were at his horse’s head, his weapons were secured,
and he found himself, in the space of about half a minute,
helpless, blindfold, half-stifled, and a prisoner!</p>

<p>Accustomed as he had been in his adventurous life to every
sort of catastrophe, the present seemed to him the most unaccountable
and startling of all. He had not witnessed the
chafing warden’s interview yesterday with calm, impassible,
unscrupulous Moray, nor guessed how much he had to thank
his host, that imprisonment rather than death was his present
fate. He knew nothing of the conclave held over their wine
after he had retired last night by the three nobles, when
Rothes had suggested so jovially that he might be blinded
or left in a dungeon for life, or hidden out of the way altogether,
in any manner that was most agreeable to his boon
companions.</p>

<p>‘For,’ as the peer politely put it, while he filled his cup to
the brim, ‘you need have no fear of inconveniencing <em>me</em>. We
have a saying in Fife of which I have always endeavoured to
uphold the truth&mdash;“Ask no questions of the Leslies, for their
answers are sharp, silent, and to the point.” If he goes
down a certain winding-stair in my poor house you might
never hear of him again till you wanted him; and if need be,
I could produce you his bones, at any rate, twenty years
hence. Do not hesitate, I pray you; I am only happy to
accommodate the warden. Bothwell, your good health!’</p>

<p>Nor had he overheard the orders accepted so unwillingly
by poor ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ an hour or two before dawn,
nor that worthy’s eager remonstrance and extreme unwillingness
to fulfil his chief’s behests. Perhaps the henchman never
felt so keenly that he was a vassal as when he told off six
stout jackmen for the unwelcome duty, and informed them of
the catchword, ‘<em>the Laird’s bidding</em>,’ at which they were to
muffle and pinion their prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Maxwell knew it was useless to complain. A request for
a little air was so far complied with that the plaid, while it
still blinded him, was enough loosened to admit of his breathing
more freely; but no answer was vouchsafed to the few
indignant questions that, in his first surprise, he had put to
his captors. The pace, too, at which they were now going,
forbade conversation, and in the few words exchanged at intervals
between the jackman, their prisoner failed to distinguish
the tones of ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh.’ Notwithstanding the henchman’s
treachery, Maxwell’s heart sank a little within him to
think that he was deserted by his last friend.</p>

<p>After many hours of hard riding, and when he could not
but feel that his horse was becoming completely exhausted,
the fresh sea-breeze made him aware that he was approaching
the Firth. With no unnecessary violence, though with much
rapidity, he was, ere long, lifted from the saddle and placed
in a boat, but the plaid was still kept round his head, and an
unbroken silence preserved even by the men who handled the
oars. It must have been long after nightfall when they made
the opposite shore, and Maxwell, despite his hardy frame, was
becoming faint and exhausted from fatigue, vexation, and
want of food.</p>

<p>As he was again forced into the saddle, however, a flask of
brandy was applied to his mouth, and at the same time a
strong bony hand grasped his own warmly, and ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’s’
welcome voice whispered in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Tak’ anither sup, lad, and keep your heart up. Ye’ve
gotten a friend to your back for a’ that’s come and gone yet.’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There is one saint in the calendar, who at least has never
lacked worshippers; at whose shrine the strictest sectarians,
the bitterest Reformers, have never failed to lay their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
votive offerings, and in whose train shine myriads of the
brightest and fairest beings we can picture to ourselves, the
only angels that gladden the sight of us adoring mortals here
below. Yes, blooming maidens, buxom widows, constituting
a phalanx beautiful to look upon, as it is dangerous to deal
with, have for centuries conspired to do honour to sweet St
Valentine, and we can only regret that the anniversary of his
martyrdom (kissed to death, we have always been taught to
believe, and buried by turtle-doves, under a shower of orange-blossoms)
should occur at a season of the year when in our
own climate the usual concomitants of frost and snow seem
so inappropriate to the indolent and relaxing amusement of
love-making. We have no reason to believe that the 14th of
February 1564, afforded any contrast to the usual boisterous
inclemency of a Scottish spring, or that Queen Mary and her
maidens, looking from the battlements of Wemyss Castle on
the leaden waves of the stormy Firth, had any sunshine to
gladden them save that which originated in their own breasts.</p>

<p>But the Queen at least was in the height of good-humour
and good spirits; though subject to occasional fits of depression,
Mary’s usual state of mind was kindly and cheerful;
nay, when in some rare interval of peace she was relieved
from the pressure of actual distress, or the anticipation of impending
calamity, her gay and cordial manner shed an influence
of happiness over all who came within its range; and
even Randolph&mdash;busy, intriguing, heartless, cynical Randolph&mdash;could
not but admit that ‘this Queen,’ as he calls her, ‘is
a divine thing, far excelling any (our own most worthy only
excepted) that ever was made since the first framing of mankind.’</p>

<p>Behold, then, Mary Stuart, and her maidens sitting at work
in a chamber overlooking the stormy Firth from the seaward
turret of Wemyss Castle. Without, the leaden hues of sea
and sky form a grand though savage contrast to the white
snow-mantle which wraps the undulating shores of Fife, while
the opposite Lothian coast stands out, as it were, into the
water with the distinct outline and startling appearance of
proximity peculiar to an atmosphere charged with coming
snow, and a wind from the north-east.</p>

<p>Within, an old oak-panelled chamber, hung here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
with faded tapestry, once of priceless value, but now frayed
and worn and coming rapidly into rags; grotesque, gaunt
ornaments are strewed about the room, the spoils of predatory
warfare on the Danish coast, brought hither generations back
by stern Sir Michael, the first Lord Admiral of Scotland.
Strange-looking arms and a ponderous axe or two are not in
character with the interior of a lady’s bower, nor do the grim
figures carved in wood that support the chimney on either
side of the high wide fireplace, the least resemble such cupids
and other gentle symbols as would be appropriate to the company
and the occasion.</p>

<p>Bending over her work, the Queen’s blushes come and go
with a degree of graceful embarrassment that is not unmarked
by her attendants. These are around her as usual, and, like
their mistress, occupy their fingers with considerable energy,
and doubtless allow their thoughts to stray far and wide
during the task. We of the sterner sex have probably not
the faintest idea of the comfort derived by woman from her
natural weapon, the needle.</p>

<p>It is well known, we are told, to physiologists, and the fact
is not lost sight of in our treatment of the insane, that manual
labour requiring a moderate amount of attention, such as the
prosecution of a handicraft, has a remarkably composing tendency
on the mind; but carpentering is perhaps the only
male pursuit which combines the exact proportions of physical
and mental exertion supposed to produce such beneficial
results. Few men, however, are carpenters, whereas, speaking
in general times, all women can sew, and the very act of
stitching we believe to be a complete and unfailing anodyne.
The delicate fingers bend unconsciously to their task; the
white hand flies to and fro as the dove flew round the Ark
seeking the olive-branch on which it should find rest at last;
the gentle head bends lower and lower, while thoughts,
humbled by sorrow and chastened by resignation, wander
further and further away. Presently the tears are dropping
fast upon the pattern, be it the beads of a queen’s embroidery
or the hem of a peasant’s smock; but like summer showers
they do but clear the sky when they are over, and ere the
hair is shook back, and the loving face looks up to thread the
needle afresh, all is sunshine and peace once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps no woman of any degree had oftener occasion to
practise this healing occupation than ill-fated Mary Stuart,
destined to a pre-eminence in suffering as in beauty.</p>

<p>The only male attendant on the Queen was David Riccio.
Splendidly dressed in the thickest velvet that could be procured,
that poor little Italian shivered in a corner of the
ample fireplace, preserving, to his credit be it said, his
southern good-humour even in the rigours of a cold, raw
climate, which, to use an expression from his own land,
seemed ‘to loosen every tooth in his head.’</p>

<p>Three of the maids-of-honour were unusually silent and
depressed, Mary Seton alone incorrigible as usual.</p>

<p>A portentous shiver from Riccio, which he tried in vain to
repress, made the Queen look up from her embroidery. She
could not but smile at the chattering teeth and pinched features
of her ungainly secretary, yet there was a slight tone of
irritation in her voice as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Heap more wood on the fire, if you are so cold, Signior
David; yet methinks the weather hath moderated since
morning. It cannot be so bad even now on the landward side;
but the wind whistles round this old keep of my brother’s till
we might fancy ourselves a plump of wild-fowl cowering together
for shelter on the Bass.’</p>

<p>Her eye happening to rest on Mistress Beton while she
spoke, that demure lady, who was plunged in a profound fit
of abstraction, felt herself called upon to reply, and could find
nothing more apposite to say than&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Bitter weather indeed, your Grace, and threatening
worse than ever over the Firth. Heaven help all poor travellers
by land and sea!’ she added piously, drawing at the
same time her mantle closer round her shoulders, to the utter
destruction of her stupendous ruff, a neglect of which ornamental
structure always denoted in Mary Beton extreme discomposure
of mind.</p>

<p>‘Psha! child!’ said the Queen, impatiently. ‘Travellers
are not so faint-hearted. What say you, Signior David?
We wot of some that would ride through fire and water at
our behest. Is not that the gallop of a horse I hear even
now along the causeway?’</p>

<p>‘I pray you patience, madam!’ answered the cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Italian, seeing that the Queen had risen from her chair, and
was pacing up and down in obvious expectation. ‘No
traveller that your Grace wotteth of can be on this side the
Firth to-day. Spurs are but steel; horses are but bone and
sinew; riders but flesh and blood. There can be no arrival
at the earliest for twenty hours. I have myself wagered a
collar of pearls and rubies with Mistress Seton.’</p>

<p>‘And lost! and lost! and lost!’ exclaimed that voluble
young lady, dancing rather than walking into the room from
which she had not been five minutes absent. ‘Even now the
portcullis is up, and I saw him myself ride into the courtyard
from the passage-window. Good lack, madam, such a
tall cavalier! and his poor horse looked so tired! Not a
living creature with him neither, and he called for a cup of
wine before ever his spurs had touched the pavement.’</p>

<p>Mary Stuart’s cheek turned very red, and her breath came
quick and short! the woman could not but appreciate the
compliment, however much the Queen must study to conceal
her feelings. This looked like an earnest wooer in good
truth; no laggard could thus have distanced his followers and
arrived in such an incredibly short space of time from the
southern shore. Aye! there was more lost and won on that
ride of young Lord Darnley’s than the collar of pearls and
rubies which David Riccio delivered the same evening with
such a good grace to saucy Mistress Seton. But the Queen’s
innate dignity soon reasserted itself. Signing to her ladies to
attend on her, she paced majestically from the room.</p>

<p>‘It would ill become us,’ said she, ‘to keep one waiting for
an audience who hath shown such loyal diligence in obeying
our summons; we will receive our guest in the great hall of
the castle. Do you, Signior Riccio, apprise him that we are
ready to accept his homage. Mary Carmichael and Mary
Hamilton attend us for a few minutes to our tiring-room;
we will all meet again here, and proceed at once to the
hall.’</p>

<p>Mary seldom spoke in such a measured dignified tone. It
may be that this stately manner covered some little trepidation
and heart-beating; it may be that the Queen felt timid
and bashful as the meekest village maiden. At least it was
remarkable that the most beautiful woman in Europe should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
have thought it necessary to revise her toilet, and add to her
attractions before receiving the homage of her vassal and
kinsman.</p>

<p>It was no ordinary phalanx of beauty that Darnley had to
confront when the venerable seneschal of Wemyss Castle
ushered him into the lofty hall, at the end of which, on a
portion raised by one step above the level of the floor, was
placed the royal lady to whom he had dared to aspire as his
bride; her exquisite loveliness only enhanced by the presence
of the four prettiest women in Scotland who stood behind
her. But ‘faint heart never won fair lady,’ and Darnley’s
was by no means one of those dispositions which are
prone to fail from a retiring modesty and too low an estimate
of their own advantages. Besides, he was playing a great
stake, and playing it with all the reckless audacity of a
gambler.</p>

<p>Young as he was, he well knew that the prize now before
him represented not only the Majesty of Scotland, but possibly,
nay, in all human probability, the eventual succession
to the English throne. It was this contingency which made
Elizabeth so jealous of all matrimonial overtures to her beautiful
cousin; it was this which caused Cecil and Throckmorton,
and their agent Randolph, to lay their cunning heads together
and devise means for amusing the Scottish Queen with a procession
of suitors, none of whom were ever intended to be
more than the puppets of the moment, each to prevent the
attainment of his object by the other.</p>

<p>The accomplished Warwick, the manly-looking, weak-hearted
Norfolk, nay, the prime favourite of the English Queen herself,
the selfish, handsome, and utterly unscrupulous Leicester,
were successively put forward as appropriate sharers of Mary
Stuart’s throne and masters of her hand. But no sooner did
the hapless object of all this intrigue and duplicity show the
slightest preference for one over the other, the faintest inclination
to accede to wishes which seemed so candidly expressed,
than instantly, like some scene in a masquerade, the performers
all changed characters at once. Elizabeth became the stern
monitress, Randolph the delicate adviser, and the belted Earls
and noble Dukes, no longer humble suitors and devoted champions
of their idol, cooled at a breath into very coy and somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
unwilling parties to an engagement of political expediency,
only binding so long as it received encouragement at
Greenwich or Whitehall. Thus was a woman’s heart made an
object of cruel traffic and shameful double-dealing, none the
less disgraceful because its possession implied the occupancy
of a throne. Some day, perhaps, the world may be brought
to see that even in the highest places expediency can never
justify heartlessness or crime, that not only is ‘honesty the
best policy,’ but that chivalrous unselfishness and frank defiance
of evil are the surest beacons to success.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it is sad to think, that the life’s happiness
and the life itself of Mary Stuart were pitilessly sacrificed
by one of her own blood and her own sex. Surely, since the
serpent, woman has had no such bitter enemy as woman.</p>

<p>Darnley, put forward at eighteen as the rival of so many
distinguished nobles, entered on the contest with all the wilfulness
of a Stuart, and all the joyous temerity of a boy.
Though a tool in the hands of his seniors, it must doubtless
have seemed to the adventurous young nobleman no unwelcome
task to woo his beautiful sovereign&mdash;the kinswoman
whom he had already once seen when they were both mere
children, but whose charms even at that early age he had not
yet forgotten. Few men would refuse the hand of a queen,
even if she were an ugly one; what shall we say of a proposal
to try his fortune with such a paragon as Mary Stuart?
It was no wonder the lightsome young wooer rode horse after
horse to death as he posted northward in the direction to
which his star beckoned him; no wonder that he should
arrive at Wemyss Castle all alone, far ahead of his scattered
escort; no wonder that he should advance into Mary’s presence,
under all the disadvantages of haste, fatigue, and travel-stained
riding-gear, with the gallant air of a gay young knight
who goes forth to conquer, rather than that of a slave who
comes to wear a chain. As he walked up the hall, his step
was firm, his head erect, and his eye bright and open as that
of a man who sees his destiny beckoning him forward fairer
and fairer, more and more promising as he approaches.</p>

<p>The colour was very deep in Mary’s cheek, and her eyes
were fastened to the ground while he drew near, yet she
stole a good look at him somehow, too, or she would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
have been a woman. What she saw might have satisfied
even her fastidious taste.</p>

<p>Darnley was very tall and slim, but his limbs were so well-proportioned,
his hands and feet so small and beautifully
shaped, that his excessive height only gave him an air of
peculiar grace and distinction above ordinary men. Even in
the riding-dress of the period, though we may be sure that the
handsome young noble wore one of the richest material, and
of the most tasteful fashion such a costume allowed, he betrayed
those habits of refinement almost bordering on coxcombry,
which, when they accompany a fine manly person,
have such an attraction for the other sex. All the details of
his toilet had been carefully attended to before he started,
and disordered as he now was, at least on his exterior, nature
had written <em>gentleman</em> in characters that could not be mistaken.
Alas! that her pen can sometimes only trace skin
deep.</p>

<p>His face, too, was in accordance with the high-bred beauty
of his form. The line of features was soft and delicate as a
woman’s, the dark eyes shone out soft and tender from beneath
a pair of pencilled eyebrows, the dark hair clustered in
silken curls round a fair and open brow, pure and unruffled
in the calm spring-time of youth, and though the mouth was
that of a voluptuary rather than a hero, the small teeth were
so white and regular, the lips so full and red, that, had it not
been for the down beginning to shade its contour, it might
have belonged to a girl. The whole countenance would
indeed have been too effeminate, but for a bold sparkle in
the eye, which corresponded well with the manly proportions
of the frame.</p>

<p>The subject was not half so much abashed as the sovereign.
Darnley advanced confidently up the hall, then kneeling before
the Queen and kissing the hand she tendered him, he
looked boldly in her face and asked leave to deliver certain
packets with which he was charged from his mother and
kinsfolk.</p>

<p>‘But your mails have not yet arrived, my lord,’ said Mary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
‘You have outridden your retainers; you are the only one of
your party who hath yet reached us here in our hiding-place
beyond the Firth.’</p>

<p>She stopped in some embarrassment, unwilling that Darnley
should learn how much his coming had been looked for and
his arrival watched.</p>

<p>‘I have them with me here, your Grace,’ answered he,
producing at the same time a packet from his bosom. ‘I
would trust my Queen’s letters to no hands but my own,
although to remind me of her I do not need to carry them
next my heart.’</p>

<p>He dropped his voice at the latter part of his sentence, but
looked her boldly in the face while he spoke, as if to mark
the effect of his words. Boy as he was, he knew well how to
woo a woman already, and had not been slow to learn that
the reticence of true affection is the worst auxiliary in the
world. He had studied his own motto to some advantage
this adventurous young suitor, and now or never was the
time to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Avant, Darnlé,</div>
<div class="verse">D’arrière jamais.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So he kissed the fair hand once more that took the packet
from his own, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>‘None of my servants can be here for hours, madam, and
I have dared to appear before your Majesty all disordered
and travel-stained. May my rudeness stand excused in the
ardour of my desire to see the beauty which now dazzles me
so that I can hardly look upon it, and my loyal anxiety to
obey the commands of my mistress and my Queen? Am I
forgiven, madam? ’Tis said that “a lady’s face should show
grace”.’</p>

<p>‘And well it might, to such a face as yours,’ <em>thought</em> the
Queen; but she only answered a few words of commonplace
courtesy; bidding her cousin rise from his knees, and affected
to busy herself in the packet of letters she had just received,&mdash;for
Mary was again blushing deeply, and not unwilling to
hide her confusion, in the task she had thus set herself.
Truth to tell, though she had hitherto been so impervious to
flattery, the words she had just heard were stealing their way
very softly and pleasantly to her heart.</p>

<p>Seeing her thus occupied, Darnley proceeded to pay his
compliments with graceful ease to the attendant ladies, finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
time to note in his own mind their respective attractions,
and to discover that Mary Seton was the most to his taste of
all the four.</p>

<p>After a while, and it may be, somewhat disturbed in her
studies by the merry voice of her gay suitor, who came (such
is the advantage of being young) as fresh from his ride of so
many hundred miles, as if he were lately out of bed, the
Queen looked up, and with kindly courtesy bade him join
them at the noon-day meal, then about to be served. The
young courtier had the good taste to excuse himself, pleading
the want of proper attire in which to meet Her Majesty at
table, and reflecting in his own mind that he could satisfy the
hunger which he now began to feel so keenly more comfortably
alone. He saw too that he had made an agreeable impression,
and wisely determined to give it time to work. So
he asked permission to wait on his sovereign at supper instead,
and retired to refresh himself in private, and curse the
delay of his servants, whom he expected hour by hour, with
some portion of his baggage.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that in the seclusion of Wemyss
Castle, such an event as the arrival of a guest like Darnley
created no small amount of excitement and conversation.
Doubtless every point in his doublet, every hair of his head,
was thoroughly discussed and criticised, in kitchen, buttery,
and hall. The rumour spread like wild-fire through the
Castle that this dashing springald was a suitor for the hand
of the bonny Queen.</p>

<p>‘Set him up!’ as the Scottish lower orders say when they
opine that the aspirant is hardly worthy of the prize.
Nevertheless the young lord’s height, appearance, and easy
manners had already won him golden opinions of those who
judge chiefly by the eye, and when he had finished the best
part of a capon, and a goodly stoup of Bordeaux for his
breakfast, the old seneschal delivered himself of the opinion
that ‘the youth was a bonny lad, an’ a fair-spoken&mdash;forbye
bein’ a Stuart himsel’, an’ no that far off frae him that lies
out bye yonder at Flodden!’</p>

<p>Had there been any dissentients, an allusion to their
favourite hero, James IV., would at once have brought them
over to an agreement with the majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>But in Mary Stuart’s bower the engrossing theme was canvassed
with considerably less freedom. The Queen herself
was restless and ill at ease, constrained in manner and
reserved in conversation. Mary Carmichael was absent on
certain household duties; Mary Hamilton seldom opened her
pale lips now, save at matins or vespers, when she poured
from them such floods of melody as if she were indeed an
angel from that heaven to which she was so obviously hastening;
Mistress Beton had been too long a courtier ever to
broach a fresh topic of conversation, or indeed to give an
opinion frankly upon any subject whatsoever&mdash;moreover, she
had no means of learning what Randolph said to all this, and
she felt somewhat at a loss to form her own ideas without the
assistance of her false English lover; Mary Seton alone led
the charge bravely, by asking the Queen point-blank what
she thought of her young kinsman.</p>

<p>‘Nay,’ replied Her Majesty, with a smile, ‘you would not
have me give an opinion after a five minutes’ interview. The
<em>outside</em> methinks is of fair promise; at least, if “all be good
that be upcome.”’<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> A Scotch saying, equivalent to the converse of our ‘Ill weeds grow
apace.’</p>

</div>

<p>‘Aye, he’s well enough to look at,’ answered the young lady,
with the air of a consummate judge. ‘Long and small, even
and straight; a proper partner for a galliard, and, I should
say, would grace velvet doublet and silken hose better than
steel corslet and plumed head-piece. But <em>my</em> choice, now, would
be something sterner, stronger, rougher altogether; something
more of a <em>man</em>; like stout Earl Bothwell, for instance!’</p>

<p>The Queen started as if she had been stung, and answered
angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>‘How mean ye? The one is a loyal and accomplished gentleman,
the other a brawling swordsman and a traitorous rebel.’</p>

<p>‘A woman might have worse help at her need than the
Lord Warden in jack and morion, with a score of those daring
borderers at his back,’ retorted the staunch little partisan,
following out, it may be, some wandering fancy of her own.</p>

<p>The Queen did not seem loth to pursue the subject.</p>

<p>‘You were talking of looks,’ said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> ‘not sword-strokes;
and Bothwell, at his best, was bronzed and marred and weather-beaten,
and built more like a tower than a man.’</p>

<p>‘That was exactly what I admired in him,’ interposed the
damsel; ‘I even thought that scar over his eye became his
face as it would have become none other.’</p>

<p>The Queen smiled once more, and resumed, in the tone of
one who is looking far back into the past&mdash;</p>

<p>‘He certainly had more of the warrior than the courtier in
him, and doubtless he hath always done his part well and
knightly in the field; I will do him that justice. Poor Bothwell!
he must have been ill-advised indeed when he could
refuse to obey <em>me</em>. I thought I could have trusted him if all
Scotland besides had failed me. Well, well! all must be
forgiven now&mdash;and forgotten.’</p>

<p>She spoke the last words in a melancholy tone, and each
relapsed into silence, for both the Queen and her damsels
seemed to have ample food for thought; so their fingers
flew over the tapestry more nimbly than ever, and the work
proceeded with extraordinary perseverance till supper-time.</p>

<p>But if Darnley had been pleasant to look at in his travel-stained
riding-gear, the most fastidious eye must have admitted
that he was indeed splendidly handsome when he
appeared, prepared to perform the menial offices of the Queen’s
supper-table, clad in a suit of gorgeous apparel, cut in the
newest fashion of the English Court. Refreshed with food
and repose, sleek from the bath and perfumes of his toilet,
radiant with hope and excitement, the young courtier stood
before his sovereign probably the best dressed and the best
looking man that day in her dominions.</p>

<p>After he had gone through the form of presenting Mary
with the basin and ewer, which she declined, she bade him
sit down at the same table with herself and her ladies, for the
Queen disliked ceremony, and always dispensed with it in
private to the utmost. Then did Lord Darnley strain every
nerve to be agreeable, and with so partial an audience, it is
needless to say, succeeded beyond his highest expectations.
Skilled in those outward graces which make so good a show
and are so effective in society, it was an easy task to him,
even in the presence of royalty, to lead the conversation round
to those topics on which he was best qualified to shine.</p>

<p>His descriptions of his journey, his humorous account of the
difficulties he experienced in procuring horses at the different
posts, with a covert allusion here and there to his impatience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to get on, were listened to with laughter and interest by all&mdash;with
rising colour and heaving breast by <em>one</em>; while in no circle
probably of either kingdom could his graphic sketch of the
English Court, with its petty intrigues and latest scandal, have
been appreciated with such thorough zest and good-will.</p>

<p>It does not follow that Mary Stuart was displeased because
she checked him when he mimicked her ‘good sister’ to the
life, hitting, with a happy mixture of fun and malice, on some
of the most prominent foibles and grotesque points in the
character of ‘good Queen Bess.’</p>

<p>Ere the ladies rose from table they had made up their minds
that this new acquisition to their society was of unspeakable
merit; and later in the evening, when they discovered that
he could play and sing as well as he could talk, and that his
leg and foot were as beautiful as his face and hand, Mary Seton
had almost decided that such courtly graces as these were
worth all the ruder virtues of a less accomplished gallant; and
judging from her subsequent conduct, we may fairly conclude
that Mary Stuart’s opinion followed on the same side.</p>

<p>A few more days of the seclusion of Wemyss Castle,
lightened by the lively talk and winning manners of the
guest, served but to establish Darnley more securely in the
good graces of his sovereign. The weather was of unexampled
severity, and a deep snow prevented all attempts at
out-door amusements, and especially forbade those field-sports
in which Mary took such delight. The society of a handsome
young gallant, fluent and accomplished, was not likely
to be rated below its real value, when it represented the only
amusement available to five such ladies as the Queen and her
Maries, shut up in an old house during a snowstorm; and
Darnley found he had free access at all hours of the day to
their agreeable presence; but he had as yet enjoyed no opportunity
of seeing Her Majesty alone. Mary, with her own
good sense and womanly reserve, had resolved to judge for herself
more at leisure ere she committed her happiness to the keeping
of her possible husband, or encouraged him avowedly in his suit.</p>

<p>The young lord, however, impatient by disposition, and now
reckless on principle, had resolved that this brief visit to the old
seaside tower should determine his fate; he would never have
such a chance again; and on the last day of Mary’s sojourn at
Wemyss Castle he made up his mind to hazard all upon the cast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Darnley entertained few scruples of delicacy when he had
an object in view. He chose the hour when Mary Hamilton
was sure to be in an oratory which the Queen had temporarily
fitted up, to get the three other ladies out of his way; a few
gold pieces judiciously administered induced the venerable
dame who charged herself with the domestic details of the
Castle, to request the presence of Mistresses Beton and Carmichael
on a visit of inspection to vast hoards of linen hid
away in an old walnut-wood press; then seducing Mary
Seton into the long gallery under pretence of a match at
billiards, or <i>bilies</i>, as it was called, he coolly left the game
unfinished and turned the key upon that young lady, who
found herself, somewhat to her dismay, a prisoner in a remote
apartment of the Castle without the slightest prospect of
escape. Chance, too, further favoured his designs, for a blink
of sunshine had tempted the Queen out upon the battlements,
and he found her there alone looking wistfully across the
Firth towards the southern shore.</p>

<p>We are no eavesdroppers on the courtships of royalty.
Turn after turn Mary Stuart paced up and down those leads,
and still Darnley urged and argued and gesticulated, and still
his fair companion blushed and listened and shook her head.
That the interview was not entirely without results, Mary
Seton gathered from what she witnessed at its conclusion.
She had been released from durance by a domestic who
happened to be passing the door of the gallery, and hastened
immediately to excuse her absence to her Mistress. As she
approached the battlements, Darnley was offering the Queen a
ring, with every appearance of eagerness and agitation; and
although the latter obviously declined the gift, it was with a
kindliness and an embarrassment that made the refusal tantamount
to an acceptance.</p>

<p>‘For <em>my</em> sake,’ said Darnley, imploringly, ‘your subject,
your vassal, your slave for ever!’</p>

<p>‘Not yet,’ murmured the Queen, in answer; and although
she spoke very low, her whisper reached the keen ears of the
attentive maid-of-honour.</p>

<p>As Darnley left the presence he did not stop to apologise
to Mary Seton for their unfinished match. His colour was
high, his eye was very bright, there was an air of joyous
triumph in his whole aspect and bearing; perhaps he was
quite satisfied in his own mind that he had won the game.</p>

</div>

<p>The Court was now established at Stirling, and a very
dull and melancholy Court it was. The visit at
Wemyss Castle had indeed borne ample fruit; but as if
there was some fatality hanging over Mary Stuart’s head,
the days of courtship which, with most women, form such a
happy era in life, were fraught for her with much annoyance,
vexation, and distress. Though she had listened coyly at
first to her handsome young suitor, she had not prohibited
him from broaching the agreeable subject again; and by the
beginning of April Lord Darnley was known to the whole of
Scotland as the accepted lover of the Queen. It is needless
to dwell upon the confusion created by such an announcement
at the different Courts of Europe, where her marriage
had been made the subject of endless intrigue and diplomacy,
nor the access of ill-humour which it produced in Elizabeth,
who could never make up her mind as to the exact manner in
which she should treat her cousin. Cecil was sharply reproved
for not having earlier foreseen so probable a contingency;
Randolph received a rap over the knuckles for his
tardiness in forwarding the disagreeable intelligence; and
Lady Lennox, for no graver offence than that of being
Darnley’s mother, was committed to the Tower.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the popular opinion was in favour of the
match, although the vulgar, with their usual love for the
marvellous, affirmed that their Queen’s affections had been
gained by magic arts; the favourite rumour being that
Darnley had presented Her Majesty with an enchanted
bracelet, made by the famous sorcerer Lord Ruthven, who
had shut himself up fasting for nine days and nights for the
purpose, and finished it off in so short a space of time with no
assistance but that of the arch-fiend, his fellow-workman.</p>

<p>The spell, however, which the lover had cast upon his
mistress was probably stronger than anything likely to result
from the black art, originating as it did in beauty of person,
charm of manner, and above all, the sympathetic attraction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
young blood. That they had plighted their troth to one another
was only to be presumed from the intimacy the Queen permitted
him, and the obvious delight she experienced in his society.</p>

<p>Randolph was puzzled. He was fain to have some certain
intelligence to convey to Cecil; and, although he had
thoroughly sounded Mary Beton, who was beginning to get tired
of attentions which never became more definite, he suffered
no opportunity to escape him of watching the affianced pair.</p>

<p>The Court, we have said, was dull and melancholy. Darnley,
stretched on a sick bed with an attack of measles, was
sedulously attended by the Queen. His illness shed a gloom
over the royal household, and Randolph was nearly satisfied in
his own mind that the marriage was as good as concluded. He
resolved, nevertheless, to place his suspicions beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>It was a sunshiny day in April, and the diplomatist knew
that he was likely to see Mistress Beton on the southern
terrace of the Castle about noon. He awaited her there
accordingly, with a great affectation of anxiety and agitation.
The lady, on the contrary, looked three inches taller than
usual, and was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>‘I have longed to see you, fair madam,’ said the courtly
gentleman; ‘there is no sunshine for me where Mistress Beton
is not, and I pine like some tropical bird for the reviving
warmth of her smiles.’</p>

<p>The comparison seemed a little ridiculous, as she contemplated
‘the bird,’ dressed with scrupulous attention, in
the extremity of the mode, and wearing an enormous ruff.
She smiled somewhat scornfully, as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You seem to keep your plumage marvellously sleek in the
shade.’</p>

<p>‘The bird seeks its mate,’ answered he, laughing good-humouredly;
‘and the two-legged creatures here below, like
the fowls of heaven, always wear their gaudiest feathers in
the pairing season. Mistress Beton, the cage-door is open at
last, and you are now free. Is it not so?’</p>

<p>He took her hand while he spoke, and pressed it warmly, but
she released it with an impatient gesture, and answered angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What mean you, Master Randolph? My freedom is not
dependent upon <em>you</em>, I trow; nor do I see in what manner it
concerneth you. I pray you, sir, let go my hand!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, but is it not true that the Queen-bird hath chosen
her mate?’ he proceeded affectionately, and determined not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to be affronted, at least not yet. ‘In plain English, or rather
in your pretty Scotch, tell me truth, fair Mistress Beton: this
Queen of yours hath given her consent to her kinsman, and
the maidens are released from their vow?’</p>

<p>‘I am not here to tell my mistress’s secrets,’ answered the
lady, none the less severely that her conscience reminded her
she had not always been so discreet. ‘Surely Master Randolph
can get information more reliable than mine, or he hath
indeed lived in ignorance for long!’</p>

<p>She was thinking that he had of late neglected her shamefully;
but although his quick ear detected much of pique in her
tone, there was so little affection in it, that he determined to
alter his tactics, but warily, of course, and by degrees.</p>

<p>‘You are offended with me, Mistress Beton,’ said he, in a
quiet, mournful voice, ‘and therefore you are pitiless. Well,
you will know better hereafter, perhaps when it is too late. I
have but remained at this Court for the sake of others, and
now it is time that I was gone. You must yourself know
that my position here has been a false and delicate one: I am
looked on coldly by your Queen; I am an object of jealousy
and distrust to this new favourite of hers; I am continually
reproached by my own employers for betraying too strong
a bias towards the Scottish interest; and, worse than all,
those whose good opinion I most value, and for whose sake
I have lost so much, turn upon me at the last, and seem
determined to fall out with me, whether I will or no. But
it takes two to make a quarrel, Mistress Beton, and I am
resolved not to be one. Farewell! we part friends. Is it
not so?’</p>

<p>A woman could hardly resist such an appeal from a man
whom she had once cared for, if ever so little. She gave him her
hand frankly, of her own accord this time, and murmured a
few commonplace expressions of leave-taking and good-will.</p>

<p>Randolph bowed over the hand he held, and drew a rare
jewel from his doublet.</p>

<p>‘You will accept this from me as a keepsake,’ said he,
coldly and courteously; ‘perhaps you will look on it sometimes,
and think of me more kindly when I am gone.’</p>

<p>It was a large gold locket, in the form of a heart, suspended
from two clasped hands, richly ornamented with precious
stones, and of a peculiar and fanciful device. Mary Beton
started when she set eyes on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Where did you get that?’ she exclaimed, completely
thrown off her guard. ‘It belongs to the Queen!’</p>

<p>Randolph owned one peculiarity: he never smiled when he
was really pleased, but had a trick of half shutting his eyes
when he considered he had the best of the game; he looked
as if he held a trump card now, while he answered quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>‘That is surely mine own which I have fairly won. Lord
Darnley paid me with that trinket in lieu of the fifty gold
pieces he lost, when you and I beat Her Majesty and himself
so handsomely at billiards the day before he was taken ill. I
never thought the house of Lennox was overburdened with
money, yet I can hardly believe its fortunes are at so low an
ebb, that its heir must pay his debts with his love tokens.’</p>

<p>‘It <em>is</em> so, nevertheless,’ said Mary Beton, indignantly. ‘It
was the Queen’s locket, and I saw her give it him with loving
words, a thousand times more precious than the gift. Out
upon him! a false knight! a recreant! I would have pawned
my doublet first!’</p>

<p>Randolph had learned all he wanted to know. With a few
kind phrases he soon took his leave of his companion, hurrying
off, we may be sure, to convey the result of his inquiries
without delay to his Court. It was not till he had been gone
several minutes that Mary Beton cooled down sufficiently to
reflect how indiscreetly she had suffered herself to be surprised,
and how very unsatisfactory had been hitherto her
dealings and relations with the English Ambassador.</p>

<p>The Maries were indeed all in trouble now, more or less.
Here was their leader, the lady who expected them to look
up to her for counsel and example, awaking to a sensation the
most galling perhaps that can be experienced by the female
heart&mdash;that of having been cozened out of its affections by
one who has given nothing in return. In one way or another
we all of us go on playing silver against gold all our lives
through, but it is not in human nature to have this humiliating
truth thrust upon its notice without vexation. Mary Beton
fairly ground her white teeth together when she thought how
near she had been to loving Mr Randolph very devotedly, and
how that astute gentleman had been making a cat’s-paw of
her all through, never so much as burning the tips of his own
fingers the while. It was an aggravation to reflect on Ogilvy’s
honest nature, and the sincere homage she had spurned for the
sake of one so much inferior in every manly quality to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
frank-hearted soldier. And now Ogilvy was absent from the
Court, and perhaps consoling himself for her unkindness in the
smiles of another. Well, he would come back again; and it
would go hard but she would resume her sway, if once she
turned her mind to it, and was really determined to try.</p>

<p>A woman’s spirit is tolerably elastic. We may say of it, as
Horace says of the shipwrecked merchant, ‘<i>mox reficit rates</i>;’&mdash;the
bark may have had awful weather to encounter, have
lost spars, and masts, and tackle by the fathom, perhaps
damaged her screw, and sustained one or two very awkward
bumps against a shoal&mdash;never say die! she puts in hopefully
to refit, jury-masts are rigged, fresh canvas bent, leaks carefully
stopped, and damages repaired; the first fine day she
launches forth to sea again, almost as good as new.</p>

<p>But there are some exceptions that cannot thus recover, some
natures to whom one keen disappointment of the affections is
a moral death-blow; nay, there <em>are</em> rare cases in which such
a wound is physically fatal. Mary Hamilton had never been
like the same woman since Chastelâr’s death. With a pale
cheek and a languid step she went about her duties indeed
as usual, but the light of her life seemed to be gone, and the
only time a smile ever crossed that beautiful sad face was
when, in the exercise of her devotions, the soul seemed to
assert its superiority over the body, and to lift itself out of this
earthly darkness into the ‘everlasting day’ beyond. Everyone
who came about Mary Hamilton seemed to acknowledge
the refining influence of a spirit thus purified by suffering.
The fiercest barons, the rudest men-at-arms felt softened and
humanised while in her presence, and James Geddes the fool,
after sitting gazing into her face for hours together, would
break into a succession of such unearthly moans as subjected
him to the discipline of the porter’s lodge forthwith.</p>

<p>Lively Mistress Seton was losing somewhat of her spirits
and her elasticity. The laugh was no longer so frequent,
though it might ring out at times as saucily as ever, and the
step, though light and buoyant still, had acquired a more
sober and regular tread as she went upon Her Majesty’s errands
through the gloomy passages of Stirling Castle. The young
lady was learning to think. In her heart she did not
thoroughly approve of this proposed match on which the
Queen was now so bent, and considered Lord Darnley, with
all his outward advantages and accomplishments, by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
good enough for her dear mistress. Mary Seton had seen
through him at once, as a woman often does, and detected
under that fair outside the frivolous disposition, the reckless
passions, and the utter want of heart beneath. If she had
given her honest opinion, she would have said Bothwell was
worth a dozen of him, and his big henchman, a hundred.</p>

<p>And what of Mary Carmichael? Proud, self-reliant, and
undemonstrative, she was the last person on earth to have
admitted that any anxiety or disappointment of her own
could have deprived her cheek of one shade of colour, or
dimmed her eye of one ray of brightness, and yet beautiful
Mary Carmichael was losing day by day much of that brilliant
freshness which had constituted no small portion of her
beauty, and went about mournfully and in heaviness, as one
who suffered keenly from some secret sorrow; yet the stranger
who used to meet her in the garden at Holyrood had been seen
at Stirling, and his clandestine interviews with the fair maid-of-honour
had been of late more frequent than usual. If she
was the happier for them, her appearance strangely belied her.</p>

<p>Yes, the Court was very dull now. Darnley was on a sick
bed, and Mary and her maidens were in trouble, one and all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘“Fear ye nae that,” quo’ the laird’s Jock,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">“A faint heart ne’er won a fair ladie;</div>
<div class="verse">Work thou within, we’ll work without,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And I’ll be sworn we’ll set thee free.”’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our worthy friend, ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ seemed strangely
altered as he rode back into Liddesdale. A moody man
was Dick, and a silent; no longer the jovial comrade and
‘devil-may-care’ trooper that the other jackmen had heretofore
known him, but a sulky and captious fellow-traveller, an abrupt
and peremptory martinet. The borderer was beginning
to find that he had a conscience, and to discover how unpleasant
are the remonstrances of that monitor when displeased.
His heart smote him sorely while he reflected on the part he
had been compelled to play with regard to Maxwell, a man
whose whole character had inspired him with admiration and
respect, in whom also, as a constant frequenter of the Court,
he took an affectionate interest that he did not care to analyse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
And now he had lured this frank and friendly soldier into a
trap from which it was doubtful if he would escape with life.
The towers of Leslie were thick and lofty, and well-guarded;
the retainers of Rothes noted, like their chief, for an unscrupulous
recklessness and defiance of all consequences. What
chance for the naked prisoner in such a stronghold? Those
damp and gloomy vaults could keep a secret well. It needed
no outrage, neither steel nor poison, to silence an inmate for
ever. The jailer had but to forget a small black loaf, neglect
to fill a shallow cruse of water, and who would ever chronicle
the prisoner’s agonies in a torturing, lingering death? ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’
turned sick and faint at the thought.</p>

<p>He had ample leisure to indulge these painful fancies, for
the rapidity with which Maxwell had been conveyed into
Fife necessitated a slow return, even on the same powerful
horses that carried the men-at-arms of Earl Bothwell. Ere the
weary animals pricked their ears to welcome the towers of Hermitage,
Dick had come to a resolution which neither discipline
nor loyalty would have tempted him to abandon. His comrades,
more astonished than irritated at the change in one
whom they had been accustomed to consider the very pattern
of a moss-trooper, shook their heads, and whispered one
another that ‘muckle Dick was <i>fey</i>,’ signifying <i>doomed</i>,&mdash;it
being an old Scottish superstition that any sudden and complete
change in the disposition of an individual denotes an
early death. When Dick sat silent among the wassailers below
the salt, and passed the black flagon untasted by, many a
roistering associate looked a thought graver for the moment,
as he pictured his old comrade stretched upon the heather,
with the pale gleam of death upon his face, and a ‘false
Southron’s’ lance through his body, a thought graver perhaps,
for an instant, till a coarse jest or a fresh draught of ale
brought him back to the gross and the material once more.</p>

<p>Hermitage Castle was no lightsome residence now. But
for the return of military duties and the clang of arms at
stated intervals in the court, it might have been a college or
a monastery, so rarely was the voice of merriment heard within
its walls. No more hawking and hunting now. The drawbridge
had not been lowered, nor the portcullis raised, since
Moray took his departure with his solemn smile, following
wild Rothes and his spearmen at half-a-day’s interval, and
leaving the lord of the castle in a mood of such stern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
sullen defiance as caused the boldest of his retainers to shrink
instinctively from his path. It seemed like another life, that
they used to lead long ago,&mdash;dashing out in the dewy mornings
with hawk on hand and hound at heel, or winding warily away
in warlike order at set of sun for a moonlight foray on the
Southern side. The rude spearmen consoled themselves with
great meals of beef and floods of ale, but the henchman’s
platter often remained untouched, his cup unfilled, whilst the
lord of the castle himself spent whole days of solitude in his
own chamber, walking out at sunset to the northern rampart,
where he would pace up and down for hours, far into the night.</p>

<p>His good angel had abandoned Bothwell at last, yet the
spirit had left a gleam of his presence, a fragrance from its
wings, about him still. Fast in the toils of unscrupulous
Moray, the earl could yet look back with a painful longing to
the days when he was a loyal subject and a devoted knight
to his beautiful Queen. At times he would be tempted to
forego ambition, pride, revenge, consistency, everything but
his wild unreasoning affection, and, galloping to Holyrood or
Stirling, fling himself at Mary’s feet, entreat her to forgive
him, and pledge himself, if it would make her happier, that
he would never see her face again. Yes, there were moments
when the proud, strong man felt he would ask no more welcome
relief than to bow his head and pour his heart out like
a woman in tears before his Queen; but then he thought of
Darnley’s youthful beauty, and Darnley’s mocking smile&mdash;of
the path that was still open to himself if he would crush all
such foolish weaknesses, all such exaggerated notions of
chivalry and forbearance. The fiend, who is always at hand
with his temptations, if a man gives him the least encouragement,
whispered in his ear that <em>nothing</em> is impossible to one
who has no scruples, and who will ungrudgingly risk all;
that when honour, honesty, faith, and humanity are but rated
as flimsy superstitions to bind weak intellects, and crime
itself is considered simply as an untoward necessity or a
decisive manœuvre, the will becomes all-in-all, and the master-spirit,
that can <em>dare</em> boundlessly and unflinchingly, may aspire
to the fulfilment of its boldest wishes and its wildest dreams.
Bothwell, too, had been brought up in no precise or scrupulous
school. In his adventurous career on the North Sea,
many a scene of bloodshed and rapine had come under his
notice, and one who had accustomed himself to direct those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
predatory descents on the Danish coast, which were but
authorised acts of piracy after all, was not likely to entertain
much compassion for a woman’s shriek or a man’s death-groan.
It would have been no shrinking from bloodshed that could
have deterred Bothwell from any scheme on which he had
once thought well to enter.</p>

<p>Moray, too, had got the Earl completely in his hands.
That wary statesman, in whom the <i>suaviter in modo</i> seems to
have been admirably combined with the <i>fortiter in re</i>, had the
peculiar faculty of acquiring unbounded influence over his
associates, a power sometimes observable in the calm impassive
nature which never betrays its own feelings. Whatever
might be the plot on which he was engaged, how high soever
ran the waves through which the base-born Stuart steered his
bark, not a shade of trepidation was to be detected on his
quiet brow during its voyage, not a gleam of satisfaction when
he had landed his cargo safely in port. It may be that men
felt, so long as their interests were identical, they could <em>trust</em>
Moray not to betray himself or them. It may be that, though
sadly warped to evil, his was a superior nature, born to command.
Whatever was the cause, no intriguer could be more
plausible, no party-leader more successful.</p>

<p>And Bothwell, eager, hot-headed, vain, perhaps even romantic,
was a mere child in the hands of such a man as this.
What could avail the bluff straightforward courage of the
swordsman against the diplomatic <i>finesse</i> of the equally bold
but far more subtle statesman? It was the old story of the
long sweeping sabre against the delicate rapier skilfully
handled. The broad blade whistles through the air with
mighty strokes that would serve to cleave a head-piece or to
lop a limb, but ere it can descend amain, the thin line of
quivering steel has wound its sinuous way under the guard
and through the joints of the harness, and is drinking the
streams of life-blood from the heart. Earl Bothwell was
bound hand and foot to the half-brother of his Queen.</p>

<p>All these intrigues and vexations goaded the warden to
the verge of madness. He could scarce bear to be noticed,
much less addressed, by his retainers; and it was with a fierce
oath and a savage glare that he accosted his henchman when
the latter ventured to interrupt his solitary walk, one summer’s
evening, on the northern rampart.</p>

<p>The stars were coming out one by one in the soft twilight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
sky, and the warden paced moodily to and fro, looking ever
and anon wistfully towards the north.</p>

<p>‘What lack ye, man, in the fiend’s name?’ exclaimed the
earl, angrily. ‘Must every knave that clears a trencher come
into my presence unbidden? Silence, varlet, and begone!’</p>

<p>But Dick, too, had a sore heart and a perplexed brain, a
combination which renders a man somewhat careless of outward
observances. He was not to be daunted, even by the
displeasure of his chief, and he answered doggedly in return&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I’ll no be silent when it’s for the laird’s honour that I
suld speak! Oh! Bothwell, man, me an’ mine has served
you an’ yours ever sin’ Scotland was a kingdom, I’m thinkin’.
Will ye no hear me speak the day?’</p>

<p>Dick’s voice shook when he alluded to his feudal services.
Stern as the giant looked, he was hoarse and trembling with
emotion. Something in the warden’s breast responded to
the appeal of his retainer, and he answered with assumed impatience&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Say your say, man, in the devil’s name, who seems to be
commanding officer here; out with your report, if report it
be, and have done with it.’</p>

<p>‘I wad wage my life for you, Bothwell, and that ye ken
fine,’ replied Dick, with something almost like tears shining
in his eyes. ‘I wadna grudge to shed every drop of bluid
I hae, just to keep ye frae watting your foot. It’s no danger,
an’ it’s no disgrace, an’ it’s no death that wad daunton
<em>me</em> frae doing the laird’s bidding. No, no, “Dick-o’-the-Cleugh”
and Dick’s forbears ha’ eaten the Hepburn’s bread
and drunk frae the Hepburn’s cup ower lang for the like o’
that. But it’s just rackin’ my heart to think o’ yon lad in
the donjon-keep at Leslie, and him breaking bread in the Hepburn’s
hall, and setting his trust on the Hepburn’s honour.
And to think o’ the like o’ me pittin’ his feet in the fetters
and his craig in a tow; I wish my hands had rotted off at the
elbows first!’</p>

<p>‘What would you have, man?’ said his chief, somewhat less
impatiently than the henchman had expected. ‘’Tis a mettled
gallant, I grant ye, and a far-off kinsman of my own. What, then?
A soldier must take his chance; ’tis but the fortune of war.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>
<p>‘An’ whan the leddies speir for their messenger at Holyrood,
an’ the bonny Queen hersel cries, “Ou, he’s safe
enough, I trusted him to Bothwell;” how will we look if ever
we come lilting into the Abbey-yard, and can give no tidings
of our guest?’</p>

<p>The warden’s brow softened, although he seemed considerably
perplexed.</p>

<p>‘I would he were safe back again, Dick,’ replied he, ‘I
care not who knows it; but Rothes has a firm grip, and he
would like well to make favour with Moray, even though he
should disoblige <em>me</em>. I wish poor Walter may not be in a
prison from which there is no breaking, at this present speaking.
Aye, Dick! times are changed since my father’s day.
Earl Patrick, now, if he had wanted anything from the
proudest baron in Scotland, would have gone and taken it
with a hundred riders at his back.’</p>

<p>Dick snapped his fingers in great glee. He was reading
his chieftain’s thoughts as he would have read the track of a
herd of cattle driven but yesterday into Cumberland.</p>

<p>‘It wadna tak’ a hundred men,’ said he, exultingly, ‘to lift
the plenishing of Leslie Hoos itsel’, though it were garrisoned
with a’ the loons in Fife. I wad but ask for Ralph Armstrong
and “Lang Willie,” an’ maybe Little “Jock-o’-the-Hope,”
to bring awa’ Maister Maxwell in a whole skin, gin he
lay in the heart o’ Carlisle jail!’</p>

<p>‘It might not be a bad ploy for some of our lads,’ answered
Bothwell, with rather a fierce smile. ‘Horses get fat and
men lazy cooped up here within four gray walls, and I might
require man and horse in proper trim before long. Hark ye,
Dick! if ye want to go northward for some ten days or so, I
shall not ask ye where ye have been at your return. No
thanks! leave me, man! If it come to blows, that long body
o’ yours can take care of itself.’</p>

<p>For the next hour or two ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ looked like
a different person as he busied himself preparing man and
horse for a march that he determined should commence at nightfall.
When the sun had set, and the earl, after deeper potations
than ordinary, had retired from his habitual walk on the rampart,
his henchman and three companions rode steadily out of
the castle-yard, followed by many inquiring looks from their
comrades, who, heartily wearied of their forced inaction,
beheld with strong feelings of envy the departure of the little
cavalcade. It consisted but of four individuals, nevertheless
it would have been difficult among all Lord Bothwell’s
retainers to have selected a more efficient-looking <i>quartette</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
With the exception of ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ himself, Ralph
Armstrong was esteemed the most powerful man in Liddesdale;
he was a stolid-looking fellow, too, with considerable
mother-wit concealed under a composure that nothing could
ruffle, and a courage that nothing could daunt. ‘Lang
Willie,’ again, was an exceedingly voluble and amusing
companion, chiefly distinguished for his extraordinary skill
as a swordsman, and the readiness and coarseness of his
repartees. Little ‘Jock-o’-the-Hope,’ so called simply because
he was the youngest of the party, was an active, limber,
powerful fellow, with all the mettle of his twenty summers
and the sagacity of twice his age.</p>

<p>With such a following, and a moonless night in his favour,
Dick would have been nothing loth to lay a wager that he would
cross the Southern Border, and take Lord Scrope by the beard.</p>

<p>They rode all night merrily enough; steadily though, and
careful not to distress their horses. As they neared the capital,
Dick’s spirits rose visibly, and his comrades could not but remark
on his resumption of his old habits of good-fellowship; but
at daybreak an incident occurred which cast a gloom over the
henchman’s superstitious nature, and plunged him once more
into that gloomy taciturnity which was so foreign to his real
disposition.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of the dawn. Dick was riding at the
head of the party, who followed in single file, for the tract
lay through some boggy and broken ground in which two
horses could not go abreast. Suddenly a hare that had been
cropping the dank herbage thus early, stole into the path in
front of them, and leaped slowly along under the very nose of
the henchman’s charger. This, although an untoward omen,
was too common an occurrence to create alarm. There was
an established <i>formula</i> for all such cases made and provided.
Though too good a Protestant to cross himself, Dick repeated
the customary charm with edifying gravity; but, as though
in defiance, the hare still kept on in front of them. At three
different angles in the path she hesitated, seeming about to
turn off to right or left, and then hopped slowly on in the
direction they were travelling. The stout borderers grew
pale. It was even proposed that they should retrace their
steps and abandon the enterprise; but Dick suggested that
as he was the person immediately in front, his must be the
entire risk, and the warning must be especially intended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
him. The others were well satisfied to take this view of the
matter, and presently they were discoursing as blithely as
before; but their leader felt a depression of spirits creeping
over him, which he strove in vain to overcome, and as the
gloom gathered darker and darker about him, he felt in the
depths of his rude nature that presentiment of coming death,
which, let philosophers say what they will, is no unusual
precursor of the final catastrophe.</p>

<p>His past life comes back to him with strange vividness as
he rides silently on. His father’s rude gray tower at the
head of the glen; the sunny, grassy nook, where he used to
play, by the shallow burn, with five sturdy urchins like himself,
and one golden-haired brother, whom they missed at last
from amongst them, and told each other in awed whispers,
looking up at the sky the while, how ‘Willie was gone to
heaven.’ Till to-day he had almost forgotten the gleam of his
father’s broadsword, and the caresses of a gentle, care-worn
woman who used to hush him to sleep with low plaintive songs.
He remembers, too, with peculiar distinctness, that first ride
on the tall bay gelding, and the mimic lance with which he
drove his imaginary foray.</p>

<p>These early memories are clearer to him now than many a
real scene of plunder and bloodshed in which he knows he has
since taken too much delight, but his devotion to his chief is
as intense as ever, albeit dashed with something of a melancholy
tenderness that seems unnatural, and derogatory to both.</p>

<p>Another figure, too, comes flitting across the borderer’s
mental sight&mdash;a figure that is seldom long absent from his
dreams either by day or night&mdash;a figure that he dares to dwell
on now for the first time these long weeks past without shame,
because he feels that he is about to vindicate his loyalty to all
belonging to her, or to her Queen.</p>

<p>He can almost hear the ringing tones of her voice, can almost
catch the flutter of her dress. Surely he is bewitched! Bewitched,
or else irrevocably doomed to death. As he gathers
a sprig of witch-elm and fastens it in his morion, he says to
himself that if he is really to die, he should like to see Mary
Seton just once again.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The four borderers rode up the High Street of Edinburgh
in the warm afternoon sun, and their leader, fortified
doubtless by the sprig of witch-elm in his head-piece, and inspirited
by his arrival at the Scotch capital, looked about him
with the gleeful curiosity of a schoolboy on a holiday.</p>

<p>On any other occasion, though troops of armed horsemen
were by no means a rare sight on the causeway, so well-mounted
and stalwart a little party would have received their
share of admiration; but to-day no man had eyes to spare for
any other object than a brilliant group of foot-passengers surrounding
two commanding figures, which neither their own
nor any other country in Europe could have matched.</p>

<p>No more in widow’s weeds, but bright and beautiful in all
the freshness of her own charms, set off by the splendour of
her dress, Mary Stuart walked by her young husband, the
<i>beau ideal</i> of a monarch’s bride: her husband <i>de facto</i> if not
<i>de jure</i>, for a private marriage some weeks since in Riccio’s
apartments had united the destinies of the lovers, and paved
the way for that public ceremony which should confer on
the fortunate young noble the crown-matrimonial of Scotland.</p>

<p>Alas for Mary Stuart! even in those happy days of courtship,
which for most women glow so brightly; immediately
before and after the nuptial tie she was doomed to many
anxieties and misgivings, originating in the ungovernable
temper of the very man for whose sake she had braved Elizabeth
of England’s displeasure, affronted a large and powerful
party of her subjects, perhaps even stifled and eradicated
certain deep though unacknowledged memories in her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
heart. Although with the utmost haste Darnley had been
created Earl of Ross, he was dissatisfied that he had not been
immediately raised to the Dukedom of Albany, and vented
his displeasure in no measured language even on her from
whose open hand he received all the benefits he enjoyed, and
whose beauty alone, bending so tenderly over himself, should
have commanded his entire allegiance.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Queen loved him none the worse for his petulance
at first; perhaps it was not till long afterwards, when
unlimited indulgence and increasing depravity had fostered
the spoiled and wayward youth into a reckless and unfeeling
profligate, that she may have contrasted Darnley’s open insults
and avowed indifference with the devotion of other
worshippers, who, however faulty in many respects, had
never failed in faith and loyalty towards <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>Darnley’s exterior was indeed beautiful exceedingly, but it
covered a disposition in which there were no brilliant qualities
of the head to counterbalance the evil of the heart. The
Earl of Ross was unfortunate in the possession of dishonesty
without craft, indecision without foresight, and obstinacy
without energy. Like a woman, he could not restrain his
tongue; unlike a woman, he never knew the exact range and
precision with which that organ is able to direct its shafts.</p>

<p>Even on his sick-bed at Stirling, when it was first obvious
to him that he had won his way into his Sovereign’s good
graces, and that a little time and care could not but make the
game his own,&mdash;even then, when it was essentially important
to cement friendships and conciliate differences in every direction,
he contrived to affront the two most formidable men in
Scotland and purchase their enmity for life. To the Duke of
Chatelhêrault, simply because he heard that nobleman was
opposed to Her Majesty’s immediate marriage, he sent his
defiance from his sick-bed, not couched in the language of
knightly courtesy, which shows a gracious respect even for a
mortal foe, but threatening to ‘knock his old pate as soon as
he should be well enough.’</p>

<p>We may imagine how such a message would be received by
one who boasted he was the proudest peer in Europe. But
an observation he made concerning the Earl Moray, and which
did not fail to reach the latter’s ears, was even more ill-advised
in its tendency and unfortunate in its results.</p>

<p>Scanning a map of Scotland, some one pointed out to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the vast estates of the Queen’s half-brother, and the inconsiderate
youth exclaimed hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>‘This is too much by half!’</p>

<p>So untoward a remark was of course repeated to Moray,
who received the information with his usual grave smile, and
never made further allusion to it. So much the worse. He
had forgotten it none the less for that, and it may be those
half-dozen words one day cost Mary Stuart a husband and
Scotland a king.</p>

<p>Meantime, who so brave in apparel or so <i>débonnaire</i> in
demeanour as the young Lord Darnley? The eyes of all
Edinburgh are upon him as he paces along so proudly by the
side of their ‘bonny Queen.’ His dress, as it is fit, is one
blaze of splendour; the materials indeed are unpaid for, and
the jewels are mostly love-gifts from his Sovereign, yet they
set off none the worse his lofty stature and his graceful form.
The women look after him admiringly; the men’s gaze is as
usual riveted on the beautiful being who walks by his side.
Mary Stuart has never shown to more advantage than to-day.
It is not the stately folds of the damask dress, nor the delicate
edging of scalloped lace, nor the rich mantle of glowing
<i>cramoisie</i> that enthral the eyes in an irresistible spell; nor
needs it that massive bracelet hanging from her shapely arm,
which men say dark Lord Ruthven fabricated for a love-charm,
with Satan standing over him while he worked, to account for
Mary’s influence; they need but to look on the bright smile
and the deep, loving eyes turned in pride and tenderness
upon her husband, and they feel in their inmost hearts that
there is no witchery in all the lore of gramarye to equal the
resistless power that lurks in a fond and trusting woman’s face.</p>

<p>Darnley has turned back for an instant to exchange some
light jest with one of the maids-of-honour; it must be of a
strangely confusing nature to account for the vivid blush that
has come over Mary Seton, dyeing her fair skin perfectly
crimson from the roots of her hair to the hem of her bodice.
‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’ riding up the street and watching intently
the motions of the royal party, does not perceive it for
the simple and somewhat paradoxical reason that, although
he has been hoping to see her the whole way from Hermitage,
no sooner has he caught her eye than his own glance is immediately
withdrawn. He turns deadly pale, too, and the
hand which guides his charger’s rein trembles in every fibre;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the good horse bends his neck and collects himself, expectant
of some further indication after this unusual touch.</p>

<p>Perhaps, poor Dick, with all his courage, might have ridden
on into Fife without more parley, so helpless and abashed had
he suddenly become, but that the Queen’s quick glance observed
the cognisance of the Hepburn as he rode by, even recognised
the tall retainer’s face, and could have accosted him
by name. There was a faint flush on Mary’s brow as she
stopped her company and bade the borderer approach. Dick
was off his horse in an instant, and the courtiers could not
but admire his magnificent form as he strode up to them in
his clanging armour, manning himself for the effort, now he
was in for it, with his natural audacity. Mary Seton did not
fail to remark, with no displeased eye, that even Darnley, tall as
he was, stood half a hand’s-breadth lower than the henchman.</p>

<p>‘What news from Hermitage, good fellow?’ said the Queen,
accepting Dick’s awkward homage with gracious courtesy.
‘How fares it with our Lord Warden yonder on the Marches?
Mayhap he is coming northward with the main body, of which
you are but the vanguard?’</p>

<p>She spoke with something of flutter and hurry that was
scarce natural to her. Perhaps she wished the retainer to
know that she bore his sullen lord no ill-will; perhaps she
even expected her vassal to return to her feet in penitence
and contrition; perhaps in her woman’s heart, even now she
could not but revert to the old times, when Bothwell’s haste
regarded neither pace nor horseflesh to gallop on far ahead
of his following, only to be the first to kneel at his Queen’s
feet and touch the hem of her garment.</p>

<p>Dick answered stoutly, though in some confusion&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The Laird’s no ailing in body, Your Grace, though he wad
be nane the waur to be whiles in the saddle a wee thing.
The Hepburns’ feet aye become steel stirrups better than
velvet mules.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He’s less wise-like than ordinar’,’ added
Dick, with a shrewd glance in Her Majesty’s face; ‘but I’m
thinkin’ he’ll bide in Liddesdale a whiley yet.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Slippers.</p>

</div>

<p>Mary laughed good-humouredly. It did not seem to displease
her that Bothwell should be sullen and dispirited. Yet
she bore him no grudge for it, obviously; rather the contrary.</p>

<p>‘The Liddesdale lads are aye welcome at Holyrood,’ said
she frankly, and with the Scottish accent she knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
assume so gracefully. ‘Take a Stuart’s word for it,’ she added,
giving him at the same time her hand to kiss, ‘both for yourself
and your chief.’</p>

<p>‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh’ kissed the beautiful hand with the
devotion of a worshipper to a saint; but his eyes wandered
beyond the royal form and sought that of a lady in her train.</p>

<p>At this moment Darnley came up from behind and accosted
the henchman with his usual overbearing assumption of
manner.</p>

<p>‘How now, whom have we here, my fair cousin?’ said the
young noble, flinging a contemptuous glance at the borderer.
‘An ambassador from Limbo Castle, sometimes called Hermitage,
by his crest! Accredited messenger from all the
thieves and sorners in the Debateable Land. How ranges
the price of good nags on the Border, knave? The nights
are moonless just now, though they be something short; the
droves should be coming in pretty fast from Cumberland.’</p>

<p>The moss-trooper’s eye brightened.</p>

<p>‘If it was Her Grace’s wish,’ said he, looking respectfully
towards the Queen, ‘we could bring the wale<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> o’ the countryside
up to Holyrood in a fortnight from this day. Lord
Scrope rides a soar gelding,’ he added, warming with the congenial
subject, ‘that steps as daintily as a bird lights on a
bough. Forbye the colour would become rarely Her Grace’s
housings and foot-mantle. If I might make so bold, I wad
engage he should be in Her Majesty’s stable or he was weel
missed at Warkworth. I wad send ain o’ my lads back for
him this very night!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Pick.</p>

</div>

<p>Darnley burst into a loud mocking laugh.</p>

<p>‘A thorough moss-trooper,’ he exclaimed, ‘rider, jackman,
plunderer, thief; call them what you will, they are all alike;
fit followers of such a chief. Were I king of Scotland I
would have the halters off the horses and put them on the
men, and string them up in rows with this tall knave at their
head, not forgetting his worthy master, the leader of the gang.’</p>

<p>The young man spoke in laughing boisterous accents that
might be taken either for jest or earnest, but the borderer’s
face flushed dark-red, and the fingers of his left hand closed
like a vice upon his sheathed sword.</p>

<p>‘If ever you <em>are</em> king of Scotland,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> ‘may ye die no
less noble a death than him who lay by the Till, yon summer’s
evening, with the proudest an’ the bauldest an’ the best
down about him like trees felled in a rank; and wha but the
borderers sleepin’, man by man, at gentle King James’s feet!
It sets a Scottish lord ill to speak again’ them that keeps the
Scottish line, an’ warst of all a limber lad like your honour
(no offence to ye), that’s got soldier written on his brow, and
swordsman marked on every yane o’ his lang limbs.’</p>

<p>The compliment to his personal appearance, always an
acceptable offering to Darnley, modified whatever he might
have considered offensive in the henchman’s plain-speaking.
The Queen, too, who had listened to the colloquy with obvious
displeasure and some uneasiness, now laid her hand on the
arm of her consort and motioned him to proceed with their
walk. The latter felt in his girdle for a couple of gold pieces,
which were not, however, forthcoming, then with a careless
laugh and a whisper in Riccio’s ear, nodded insolently to the
borderer, and passed on with Mary and her train.</p>

<p>One of these, however, lingered a few paces in the rear.
Dick’s face grew very pale once more when Mistress Seton
turned back and accosted him with her own bright glance and
her own merry smile.</p>

<p>‘You are slow of speech,’ said she, ‘I know of old, though
prompt in deed, and as true as the steel in your belt. Is it
not so?’</p>

<p>His lips were white and dry. He could not answer in
words, but his affirmative gesture was more convincing than
a hundred oaths.</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his. Through the steel gauntlet that
light touch thrilled in every vein and fibre of the giant.</p>

<p>‘You will tell me the truth,’ she proceeded. ‘What of
Walter Maxwell? We have had no tidings of him since the
morning he rode away from Holyrood, weeks and months ago!’</p>

<p>It speaks well for Mary Seton’s good nature that the subject
uppermost in her mind was one which she believed so
vitally affected the welfare of her friend. It was as much
kindliness of disposition as female curiosity that riveted her
attention on the borderer’s reply.</p>

<p>Dick’s face became a study of self-reproach and embarrassment
while he related the treachery of which Walter had been
the victim; neither concealing nor palliating his own share in
the business, which seemed to himself the less black that it
was taken in compliance with his chief’s orders, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
which his listener either forgot or neglected to reprove him.
It is impossible to take the same interest in other people’s
matters that we do in our own, and what a world of confusion
we should have if the confidants and go-betweens in a love-affair
were as much agitated as the principals.</p>

<p>Mary Seton heard him calmly enough, and then proceeded
to interrogate him about Bothwell. The henchman’s answers
concerning his chief seemed to afford her matter both
of surprise and gratification. The earl was evidently in a
state of discomfort and restlessness that must be reported at
once to the Queen, who had always betrayed extraordinary
interest in everything connected with Hermitage or the Borders,
and his rude follower seemed to have observed and analysed
his feelings with a sagacity that must have been strangely
sharpened by some influence from without.</p>

<p>If there was a more triumphant sparkle in Mary Seton’s
eye, a tinge of deeper colour on her cheek, as she reflected on
the nature of that influence, who shall blame her? Was she
not a woman; and is it not a woman’s instinct, like a cat’s, to
tease and tantalise her prey to the utmost? Though the mouse
be as big as an elephant, it is such fun to tempt him with the
prospect of indulgence, or even liberty, and then sweep him
irresistibly back again with one stroke of the cruel velvet paw.</p>

<p>Mary Seton smiled within herself, and felt twice as big as
the great borderer trembling there before her. With a whole
budget of news gained for her Sovereign, she reverted to the
topic most interesting to her comrade.</p>

<p>‘You think, then, that he is alive, though in close ward?’
she asked. ‘They are cruel folk, I have heard say, the “lightsome
Leslies.” I would poor Walter were safe out of their hands!’</p>

<p>Dick had found his voice at last:</p>

<p>‘And safe he shall be!’ was his reply, ‘before another
week has passed over his head. It may tak’ time, an’ it may
tak’ skill, an’ it may tak’ twa or three men’s lives, but we’ll
ha’ Maister Maxwell oot ’gin we ding doon Lesly itsel’, an’
mak’ a low<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that’ll light up the twa Lommonds and the tae
half o’ the kingdom of Fife! That’s what I’m here for now.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Flame.</p>

</div>

<p>She looked at him archly:</p>

<p>‘Was that all that brought you to Edinburgh?’ said she.</p>

<p>Again something seemed to choke the man-at-arms and
prevent his reply. At last he spoke in a hoarse whisper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I was fain to see the Court once more&mdash;and the Queen-and&mdash;and&mdash;yersel’,
Mistress Seton! I’ll no win back to Liddesdale,
I’m thinkin’; but I’ll tak’ the brunt o’ it bra’ an’
easy the noo, sin I’ve seen ye to wish ye farewell.’</p>

<p>Something in his tone so tender, so hopeless, and so respectful,
touched the girl to the heart. She laid her hand
once more in his, and he wrung it hard in his own strong
fingers, but did not even presume to put it to his lips. Only
as she turned away to join the Queen, a low stifled sob smote
upon her ear, and looking back she beheld the borderer
standing as if spell-bound on the spot where she had left him.
The next moment he was in the saddle, and as he passed her
moving up the street after the others, he detached the sprig
of witch-elm from his morion and cast it at her feet ere he
galloped off.</p>

<p>Mary Seton’s eyes filled with tears while she picked it up,
and Dick’s honest heart would have leapt with joy, notwithstanding
his forebodings, could he have seen her hide it away
carefully and tenderly in her bosom. When she rejoined the
royal party, Riccio’s sharp countenance wore a look of curiosity,
for his quick eye detected that she had been weeping; but
the Queen called her to her side, and soothed and caressed
her, speaking in gentle, loving tones, like a mother to a child.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Long weeks of solitary confinement in a dungeon, dark
and damp and dismal, nourished on bread and water,
and cheered only by the periodical visits of an asthmatic
jailer, appointed to that post because fit for nothing else,
would destroy the courage of most men, as it would sap their
bodily health and vigour. Walter Maxwell had need of all
his strength of mind, all his natural qualities of bravery and
endurance, to resist the influence of his imprisonment, ere he
had spent many weeks in the strong room of Leslie House.
This place of confinement, paved and walled with stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
lighted by but one window, narrow and iron-barred, communicated
with a winding staircase, and a long gloomy subterranean
passage terminating in a wicket, which opened on
a pleasaunce and flower-garden. Prisoners might thus be
smuggled in or out of the Leslies’ stronghold without exciting
observation; and unless the Lord of Rothes was much belied,
this facility of ingress was used for a variety of purposes,
foreign to its original object. On summer evenings, ’tis said,
the flutter of a farthingale might sometimes be seen emerging
from its dark recesses, while lighter steps and merrier voices
than were likely to belong to a permanent prisoner echoed in
the damp underground passage leading in and out of Leslie
House. Under these circumstances, bars were sometimes
left undrawn and locks unturned, nor was Walter ignorant of
the occasional negligence in which lay his only chance of escape.</p>

<p>The old jailer, too, albeit short in temper as in wind, was
not entirely destitute of compassion for a hungry and thirsty
man. After the first fortnight, and when he found that his
lord gave no orders for Maxwell to be starved to death, he
brought him on rare occasions a morsel of venison, or even a
flask of wine, mollified as it would seem by the courage and
good-humour with which his charge bore the rigours of captivity.</p>

<p>Then old Ralph, as he was called, would sometimes put
down his pitcher and his keys to remain for a few minutes’
conversation, or what he considered such, being indeed a
monologue on his own grievances, his own infirmities, and,
when in high good-humour, his youthful prowess and general
accomplishments. These occasional visits were as beneficial
to Maxwell’s moral condition as the meat and wine were to
his physical man.</p>

<p>After a week or two without exchanging a word with a
fellow-creature, the stupidest of companions is welcomed like
an angel from heaven, the dreariest platitudes fall like spring
showers upon a desert soil. Maxwell <em>really</em> rejoiced in the
visits of his jailer, looking forward to them as the sole events
of his long, uninteresting day, and old Ralph began to take
a great pride and pleasure in the prisoner who greeted him
so warmly, and showed himself such an accomplished listener.
By degrees the warder became confidential, not to say indiscreet,
though the last idea in his mind was to favour his
prisoner’s escape. Indeed he could not afford to part with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
him, and, little by little, Maxwell, with his energies aroused,
and his intellects sharpened by the emergency of his case, made
himself familiar with the arrangements of the castle, and the
details, of which he hoped to take advantage at some future time.</p>

<p>The sensations of a prisoner enduring solitary confinement
have been so often analysed and described, that it is needless
to enlarge upon them here. Without some distant hope of
escape, without some definite point for the mind to rest on,
the infliction would become unbearable, and end probably in
insanity. Maxwell, however, possessed one of those dogged,
resolute dispositions, not uncommon amongst his countrymen,
which, like iron at the forge, become only harder and harder
the more heavily they are struck. From the first moment of
his entrance, bound and blindfolded into the Leslies’ stronghold,
he had determined to escape. That he was not to be
put to death he argued from the pains that had been taken
to kidnap him; and the knowledge that ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’
notwithstanding his apparent treachery, was still his friend
at heart, was a vague source of comfort and re-assurance. The
hours, marked only by the shadows on the blank and dreary
wall, were indeed long&mdash;oh! so long!&mdash;but the continued
effort to keep mind and body in a condition to take advantage
of any chance that might offer, served almost in lieu of an
occupation and a pursuit.</p>

<p>The prisoner would force himself to pace the narrow limits
of his cell for hours at a time, that he might not lose the wind
and strength so necessary to that problematical flight which
was the one fixed idea of his brain.</p>

<p>By degrees Walter observed that the precautions taken for
his security became more and more relaxed. With all his
senses sharpened by constant watching, he could hear the
door, at the foot of the winding-stair which led to the subterranean
passage, although carefully locked at sun-down,
grating ajar on its hinges during the day, could detect the
summer air stealing even to his remote dungeon, denoting
that the door into the garden was also unfastened. By dint
of constant attention he became satisfied at last that if he
could but break out to the top of the stairs any time before
nightfall during the summer afternoon, he might, at least,
reach the garden without hindrance. Once there, though
ignorant of the locality, he trusted to the chapter of accidents
to make his escape into the open country beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The first object was as far as possible to hoodwink Ralph,
and that worthy’s implicit confidence in the quiet demeanour
of his charge would go far towards assisting him in his
scheme; then, when the jailer was thrown completely off his
guard, a bold stroke would effect at least the first stage of the
project. We do not affirm that the idea of springing on his
keeper, who, although armed, might have been overpowered
by a younger and a stronger man, and beating out his brains
with his own keys, did not present itself to Walter’s mind,
but such a measure was wholly repugnant to his character,
and he resolved to attain freedom without shedding the blood
of the old man who had mitigated, as far as he could, the
rigour of his captivity.</p>

<p>By little and little the prisoner had discovered that no amount
of outcry or disturbance in the dungeon could be heard without;
of this he had satisfied himself by a series of experiments.
This was always a step gained in the furtherance of his plan.</p>

<p>Fortunately for himself, also, Maxwell was a large-boned
man, especially in the wrists. Every set of fetters in the
castle had been successively tried on him and found too
tight; so for a time he had been bound hand and foot with
ropes; but on his complaining that these cut him, they had
been withdrawn, and his limbs suffered to remain at liberty.</p>

<p>So all the fine summer days, when the June roses were
blooming without, and the June grass growing, and the June
birds singing on the tree, while within the rat and the spider
were the only living creatures, and a green slime on the
wall the only vegetable production, Maxwell was preparing his
escape, and biding his time patiently for a favourable opportunity
to put it in execution.</p>

<p>When Ralph used to bring his prisoner a draught of wine,
he would sometimes, if in a particularly good humour, condescend
to stay for a few minutes and help him to partake of
it. On these occasions Maxwell, by a studiously quiet and
even languid demeanour, contrived to throw his jailer completely
off his guard.</p>

<p>One day he requested the wine might be left with him
to cheer his solitude when his agreeable friend was gone;
another time he complained of indisposition, but thought he
might relish a cup towards nightfall. By degrees he collected
a Scottish pint or so of strong red wine in a stone jar that he
had begged might be applied to the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather was very hot; even in a dungeon its inmate
could tell that the summer sun was glowing bright and fierce
without. Old Ralph arrived, according to custom, with his
prisoner’s afternoon meal, and sat himself down on the stone
floor like a man thoroughly overcome with his exertions.</p>

<p>‘Take a draught of wine, man,’ said Maxwell, pointing to
the jar; ‘’t the coolest place in the castle here, and by St
Andrew the prisoner hath the best of it to-day.’</p>

<p>The old man smiled grimly; then he took a hearty pull, as desired,
and set the vessel down with a sigh of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘An old man’s bluid aye wants warmin’,’ said he, looking
pensively into the vessel the while; ‘but I’ve kent it far
hotter ower sea. When I was in Flanders wi’ Norman
Leslie, ye ken;&mdash;aye! he was a wild lad, Norman, but
a bra’ soldier, fair sir, a bra’ soldier as ever belted on a
brand!&mdash;aweel, whan I was in Flanders wi’ Norman&mdash;&mdash;;’
and forthwith the old man embarked upon a long story of
which gallant Norman Leslie was the hero, moistening his
narrative at frequent intervals with draughts of the strong red
wine, and Maxwell watched with strung nerves and beating
heart, how his eye grew dimmer and his speech more laboured
as the tale progressed and the contents of the vessel waned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the door was locked on the inside, and the
jailer’s fingers kept an instinctive grasp upon his keys. Once,
catching Maxwell’s eye fixed on these implements, he shifted
them suddenly into the hand farthest from his prisoner,
although in the act he interrupted himself in an elaborate
description of a certain blue velvet surcoat, by which Norman
Leslie set much store, and did not again recover the thread
of his recollections until he had discovered that the wine was
done, and it was time for him to be gone.</p>

<p>But it was obviously necessary to lull his suspicions and
induce him to remain a few minutes longer.</p>

<p>‘I should like to hear how that surcoat was finished and
embroidered,’ said Maxwell, with an affectation of interest.
‘The time of my release is drawing near,’ he added, ‘and when
I go out I should wish to have one of the same colour and conceit.’</p>

<p>He spoke in so matter-of-fact a tone that old Ralph was
thrown completely off his guard.</p>

<p>‘Oot!’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> ‘it’s the first time ever I heard it, lad.
I’ll no say but I’ll miss ye! Oot! Gude presairve us! Was
there ever the like o’ that?’</p>

<p>‘I told you when I came in,’ replied his prisoner, yawning
and stretching himself lazily the while, ‘the full turn will be
out the day after to-morrow at noon.’</p>

<p>Old Ralph laid down his keys and scratched his head.</p>

<p>That instant Maxwell pounced upon them like a tiger.
Almost with the same motion he seized the old man round
the body, completely pinioning him, heavy and powerful as
he was, till he had sent him staggering to the farthest extremity
of the cell. Then, with one rapid turn of the key,
that key at which he had often looked so longingly, and of
which he knew every ward, he was through the door, as
rapidly he locked and bolted it on the outside. His hand
never trembled; his nerves were as true to him now in the
moment of success as they had been through all the dangers
and disasters he had overcome.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ thought Maxwell, as he sped down the winding-stair
like a lapwing, ‘you may holloa your heart out, as many a
poor prisoner has done before, but nobody will come near you
till supper-time. If you get not free for a week you’ll have
had a lighter captivity than mine. And now for liberty and
life, and&mdash;Mary Carmichael!’</p>

<p>He believed he had schooled himself to think of her no
more, but she came back to him with the first gleam of the
summer sun, the first breath of the summer air.</p>

<p>There is no catastrophe of grief or discomfiture so staggering
to the nervous system as the shock of a great relief or a
great joy. You shall attend the sick-bed of one nearest and
dearest to you for days together, and see the life that is more
precious than your very heart’s blood ebbing away, as it were,
inch by inch, and drop by drop, yet your eyes are dry; though
your brain feels strangely hot and seared, your hand is steady,
your tread firm, and your pulse regular. The moment on
which hang the issues of life and eternity comes at last. The
silent strife is waged between sleep and death, and the gentle
conqueror triumphs by a hair’s breadth. Never prone to give
his opinion rashly, the doctor tells you that the dear one has
escaped ‘out of danger, he is happy to inform you,’ and you
wring his hand fiercely, but something gripping at your throat
forbids you to speak your thanks. Then the tears gush freely
to your eyes; then the strong frame shakes and quivers in
every fibre, and down upon your knees you kneel before your
God, even if you never knelt before. So in all the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of life; the moment of success is the touchstone to the human
character. It is far more rare to find men bear prosperity
with equanimity than adversity. We have all heard of people
going mad for joy.</p>

<p>For an instant, Walter Maxwell had to pause and collect
his energies, manning himself as though about to undergo
some formidable trial, when he found he was at least on the
<em>outside</em> of that door which he had contemplated such a weary
while as the bar between himself and freedom. Stealthily,
and with a keen sense of delight, so overpowering as to be
almost painful, he pushed open the iron wicket at the foot of
the staircase and emerged into the garden beyond.</p>

<p>It was intoxicating to drink in the warm fragrance of the
summer air at every pore. It was bewildering, from sheer
delight, to feel the eyes ache in that dazzling sunshine, glowing
on leaf and flower, whitening the gravel walk and the
castle wall in its blinding glare. The prisoner paused in a
corner of the passage ere he came forth, accustoming sight
and faculties by degrees to the rapturous change.</p>

<p>Then he stole out and looked about him, taking in, with
keen and wary eye, the features of the surrounding scene.
Well he knew that in such a stronghold as that of the powerful
Rothes his escape had only just begun.</p>

<p>He found himself in a beautiful little garden, neatly kept
and tastefully laid out. Casting a hasty glance upward, he
ascertained that he was overlooked by no windows from the
castle; three sides of this parterre were bounded by the great
blank walls of the house, the fourth was shut in by a dark
impervious hedge of yews. With stealthy, hasty steps he was
soon on the farther side of this leafy screen and traversing a
bowling-green on which the bowls dotted the level surface at
irregular intervals&mdash;denoting that a game had been recently
interrupted&mdash;he emerged upon a beautiful little wilderness of
shrubs and flowers beyond.</p>

<p>Three or four vases and a fountain adorned this exterior
pleasure-ground, and the gigantic beeches of Leslie, perhaps
the finest trees of Scotland, shaded it with their dark gleaming
foliage. It looked like a paradise to the emancipated
prisoner; but, alas, a paradise from which there was no
escape! Surrounded by the outer wall of the castle, any biped,
unprovided with wings, seemed as much a captive in those
sunny glades as in the darkest recesses of the dungeon. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Maxwell envied the butterfly soaring into the air so freely over
that smooth and cruel wall! It would be hard to turn back
now after tasting even for five minutes the delights of liberty.</p>

<p>Casting about with anxious eyes and a fast-beating heart for
some means, however desperate, of egress, he espied a portion
of the masonry in which certain irregularities would admit of
his climbing to within a few feet of the coping. At this very
place, too, a friendly beech somewhat overhung the garden so
that one of its branches drooped downwards inside the wall.</p>

<p>With a run and a bound, like that of a wild cat, he
swarmed up its slippery surface and succeeded in reaching the
pendant branch. It was a desperate exertion of strength,
and the pain that shot across his chest warned Maxwell how
an ounce more of weight would have turned the scale in the
effort by which he swung himself into the tree. Once there,
he paused to take breath, and looked back into the garden
from which he had so happily escaped. What was his dismay to
observe, for the first time, a tall stalwart man in the guise of a
labourer, shuffling into his jerkin, and making for the house!</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ thought Maxwell, with a curse on his own
stupidity that he had not perceived the man sooner, ‘to give
the alarm and turn out the retainers for pursuit!’</p>

<p>In truth there was nothing for it now but to slip down
from the tree and trust to a light pair of heels and the chapter
of accidents.</p>

<p>Already his legs were clear of the branches, and he was
meditating a drop of some four or five yards upon the sward,
when he drew them up again with wondrous precipitation,
for the tread of feet through the grass, and the sound of
voices in earnest conclave, warned him that he was hemmed
in and beset on this side as well as the other.</p>

<p>Close under the tree, in which he couched like some hunted
animal, three gallants halted and carried on their conversation
in the deep, low, earnest tones of men who discuss those
matters on which they have bound themselves to secrecy, and
which the bird of the air itself is not to overhear.</p>

<p>Splendidly dressed, although half-armed&mdash;for a Scottish
noble loved not to be utterly defenceless, even in the heart
of his own residence, and the company of his staunchest
friends&mdash;Maxwell recognised them at once, for three of the
most powerful men in the kingdom&mdash;the wariest of statesmen,
the darkest of intriguers, the most reckless of conspirators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Not one of the three would have scrupled to cut the throat
of an unwelcome eavesdropper on the spot, whether or not he
thought a word of their conversation was overheard or understood.
That ‘makin’ sicker’ has been a favourite expedient in
the annals of our northern politicians ever since Kirkpatrick left
the Red Comyn weltering in his blood on the steps of the altar.</p>

<p>It was an unpleasant predicament for poor Walter. What
could he do but hide himself up among the branches, keep
quiet and listen, expecting besides every moment that the
alarm of his escape would be given from the castle?</p>

<p>The little conclave continued their conversation eagerly,
and as they stood beneath his hiding-place, Maxwell had
ample leisure to observe the faces and bearing of his Queen’s
three worst and most pitiless enemies.</p>

<p>Rothes was, as usual, gay and careless in demeanour; his
handsome face flushed with wine, was not out of keeping
with the disordered bravery of his apparel. He could break
his jest on treason as on any other crime; could pass through
life and its most important avocations as though it were but
one long feverish debauch in which the merriest and wildest
roisterer bore his part the best.</p>

<p>Argyle, who repressed his host’s ill-timed mirth whenever
opportunity offered, and listened attentively to the calm, measured
accents of the third person present, seemed thoughtful
and ill-at-ease. Though of a courageous character, his was a nature
that weighs well every scheme on which it enters, and loves
not to put forth its full powers unless it sees its way clearly to
success. He could not go hand over head into a plot like Rothes,
simply for the excitement and amusement of the turmoil.</p>

<p>Grave in demeanour as the man to whom he was now
listening so attentively, and not unlike him in character, he
was yet far inferior in foresight and acuteness, above all in
that mysterious force of will which bends and warps more
pliant natures to its own ends. Maxwell, watching him
intently from the tree, could not but mark how scruple after
scruple disappeared, how gradually and completely conviction
seemed to steal over his countenance, as he followed, step by
step, and argument by argument, the bent of that master-mind
which formed the third and dominant element in the conclave.</p>

<p>And who was this third conspirator, this evil spirit so much
mightier and so much more daring than the two it controlled?
Who, but Moray, the Queen’s half-brother? Staid, quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
composed as usual; less splendidly dressed, less energetic in
gesture, less striking in appearance than either of his companions,
yet obviously the leader whom they trusted implicitly
and obeyed without remorse.</p>

<p>One more faithful adherent to the House of Leslie completed
the party. His honest face and loyal courage seemed
strangely out of place where treason was brewing; a large
handsome bloodhound kept close at the heel of Rothes,
poking his wet nose at intervals into his master’s hand.</p>

<p>Even in the extremity at which he found himself, Maxwell
could not forbear contrasting the surrounding scene with the
principal actors. The white stems of the beeches shone like
silver in the glowing afternoon sun, while thrush and blackbird
carolled gaily from the deep rich screen of their heavy
foliage. Life and light, beauty and fragrance filled the atmosphere,
peace and prosperity smiled around; white sheep were
feeding on a grassy slope over against him between the trees;
red roses blooming and clustering around steeped his senses
in their perfumes; the bee hummed drowsily by in the warm
still air; overhead the swallows flitted to and fro against the
blue laughing sky; and there, at his feet, within a spear’s
length of him, frowned the three dark pitiless faces, while
Moray’s measured voice unfolded the plot that chilled his very
blood, though it roused his vindictive hatred, as he listened.</p>

<p>Not one of the others drank in every syllable as did that
eager fugitive, crouching like a wild cat along the arm of the
old beech tree.</p>

<p>‘I tell ye, gentlemen, it cannot fail,’ said the degenerate
Stuart, with more earnestness than usual; ‘the net is so
spread that fly which way she will, the bird cannot but find
herself within its meshes. I can tell ye for as certain as if I
heard her say so now, that she leaves Perth after dinner to-morrow
and rides to Callander, for the young Livingstone’s
baptism, direct; she will have no following beyond her personal
attendants, and some twenty or thirty spears. Your
Leslies, my lord, may surely make account of these.’</p>

<p>He turned to Rothes while he spoke; the latter answered
with a savage laugh, and the bloodhound murmured simultaneously
a deep angry growl.</p>

<p>‘Why, “Hubert” seems to be of the same opinion,’ pursued
Moray, carelessly patting the dog’s wide forehead, a liberty
‘Hubert’ seemed hugely inclined to resent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> ‘But I always
counsel force enough in these little matters of necessity.
“Never stretch your hand out farther than you can draw it
back again,” says our Scottish proverb; and “Never strike
at your foe if your arm be not long enough to reach him,”
say those who know how to make war with prudence and
moderation. Nay, I would have no risk run of failure or
miscarriage for want of an odd score or two of horsemen.
What say you, my lord of Argyle?’</p>

<p>That nobleman pondered a few moments ere he replied.</p>

<p>‘My following moves forward to-night. I shall find four
hundred spears at the Paren-Well to-morrow ere the sun has
gone down two hours from the meridian.’</p>

<p>‘Good!’ answered Moray, nodding his head. ‘And you,
Rothes? The Leslies are sure to be swarming when there is
aught stirring that promises a fight or a capture.’</p>

<p>‘You shall count them yourself to-morrow, at sunrise, before
we march,’ answered the other, gaily. ‘If you drink a cup
to-night, at supper, for every hundred men, your brain, my
good Lord James, will hardly be so clear in the morning as
you like to keep it when there is business to be done. Be
quiet, “Hubert!” the fiend’s in the dog! What? down,
man! art thou bewitched?’</p>

<p>The bloodhound’s bristles were rising fiercer and fiercer, and
he growled ominously as he snuffed the air with his broad
black nostrils.</p>

<p>‘Then this is the plan of the campaign,’ resumed Moray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
‘Argyle’s forces and your own join at the Paren-Well, and in
that lone district ye may dispose them to advantage, and keep
the greater part out of sight from the Perth road. To avoid
suspicion, I would counsel that ye do not anticipate the hour
of rendezvous. My imprudent sister might be informed even
when some miles upon her journey, and turn back. When
Her Grace’s palfrey enters the pass at the Paren-Well, fourscore
men-at-arms can do the business readily enough. If
there is any attempt at resistance, another troop or two may
strike in. Be careful to keep a large force fresh to protect
Her Grace’s sacred person when taken. I have arranged for
her lodging to-morrow night with her kinswoman at Loch-Leven
Castle. For the lady-faced lord, if not knocked o’ the
head in the skirmish, he must be disposed elsewhere. You
shall have him at Leslie, Rothes, an’ ye will, though I doubt you
and Darnley are but unfriends at heart. We will meet in Edinburgh
next week to consult on state affairs; but to-morrow,
being Sabbath, I have thought well to explain my views to you
both to-day. Gentlemen, I think we understand each other?’</p>

<p>Argyle murmured an assent. Rothes laughed again somewhat
dangerously.</p>

<p>‘If there is any resistance?’ said he.</p>

<p>‘I will not have a hair of Her Grace’s head ruffled, or a
fold of her dress,’ replied Moray, firmly. ‘For the escort, they
must be overpowered, of course; but Her Grace’s person <em>shall</em>
be respected, and her immediate attendants.’</p>

<p>‘You promised me the Maries!’ urged Rothes, reproachfully;
‘come, man, you shall not go back from your word;
you promised me the whole four, or at least my pick of them.
I would not have gone into it, but for the saucy Seton; and
that sunny, silent lass&mdash;how call you her?&mdash;Carmichael! I
have ordered all sorts of toys to be here, expressly for them,
to-morrow. Down, “Hubert!” be quiet, man!’</p>

<p>Maxwell’s blood boiled within him, and he griped the
branch of the beech as if it had been the last speaker’s throat.
Meantime ‘Hubert’ had been baying furiously, glaring upwards
into the tree with flaming eyes, and springing furiously
against the trunk.</p>

<p>‘The Maries must take their chance,’ replied Moray, in the
same quiet tones. ‘If Her Grace be safe, I shall ask no questions.
That dog hath cause for his uneasiness, my lord; take
my word for it, we have been overheard. He scents a fresh
foot in our neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>With a great oath Rothes drew his sword, and Argyle followed
his example.</p>

</div>

<p>The moment was one of intense anxiety and terror. Concealed
by the leaves of the old beech, every leap of the
frantic bloodhound threatened to disclose the listener’s hiding-place.
The Earls of Rothes and Argyle, with drawn
swords and bent brows, looked high and low for the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the dog’s fury. Besides the dread of a violent death, all the
more terrible at this his first hour of escape from captivity,
Maxwell now felt that on him depended the liberty of his
Queen; more than this, the life and honour of the woman he still
so dearly loved. To do him justice he would willingly have died
on the spot to be able to advertise his Sovereign of her danger.</p>

<p>For an instant the desperate expedient darted through his
mind of leaping down on Argyle’s upturned face, wresting the
sword from his grasp, and thus armed doing battle with Moray
and Rothes; but, even then, he reflected, how surely the former,
who was never surprised or at a loss, would run to the castle for
assistance. If retaken, Walter shuddered to think, not of his
own fate, but of Mary Carmichael’s capture on the morrow.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there seemed nothing else for it; he had even
collected his breath, and nerved his muscles for the spring,
when a trumpet sounded in the castle, and a puff of lurid
smoke swept across the faces of the three noblemen, who were
searching about with eager looks and bare blades, encouraging
‘Hubert’ the while with voice and gesture.</p>

<p>Again the smoke came rolling in a dun-coloured volume
against the clear sky, and the bloodhound, his attention distracted
by the new catastrophe, or his powers of scent dulled
by the smell of fire, ceased to leap at the old tree, and lowering
his stern, began to howl in abject terror and dismay.</p>

<p>Rothes could not forbear laughing, though he coughed and
swore at the same time.</p>

<p>‘’Tis the alarm!’ said he, as the trumpet again rang out in
the castle-yard. ‘Faith, Moray, I cannot but think they are
burning the old house about our heads. Gentlemen both, I
counted not to give ye so warm a reception as this!’</p>

<p>Nothing escaped Moray’s quick eye. While they hurried
back towards the building, he observed the smoke and flames
issuing from the turret Maxwell had so recently quitted.</p>

<p>‘The wind is favourable,’ said the earl, as another cloud
rolled over them, ‘and you need not fear for more than the
prison tower; for the sake of humanity, I trust, my lord, that
it may be empty!’</p>

<p>Rothes did not answer; truth to say, he had quite forgotten
Walter Maxwell, and even had he remembered him, would
have thought the life of one poor prisoner mattered but little
at such a time. The three noblemen addressed themselves to
the task of quenching the fire with characteristic energy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Backed by the exertions of Rothes’ disciplined followers, they
soon succeeded in subduing the flames, and, ere nightfall,
Leslie House had resumed its usual appearance of security,
having suffered but little damage save the scorching of its
outer wall. Poor old Ralph, however, was found dead in the
dungeon, probably stifled by the smoke. But it is not with
the inmates of Leslie that we have now to do.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, directly the coast was clear, Maxwell
lost no time in slipping out of the tree. With a fervent
thanksgiving in his heart, he dropped upon the sward, and
ran as hard as his legs could carry him in the direction of the
open country. Yet, even now, his situation was one of no
ordinary hazard and embarrassment. He was unarmed; he
was in an enemy’s country; he might meet, at any moment,
with retainers of Lord Rothes, who would recognise him at
once for an escaped prisoner. Moreover, he was weaker than
ordinary, from his long confinement, and, even had it been
otherwise, he could not expect to reach Perth on foot in time
to warn the Queen of the plot laid against her person; and
how was he to procure a horse? Cogitating these matters
with considerable anxiety, he hurried on nevertheless, and
was dismayed to find limbs and breath failing him as he ran.</p>

<p>To add to his discomfiture he heard footsteps approaching
rapidly from behind. Turning his head, he espied the countryman
whom he had already observed in the garden, nearing him
with every stride. Maxwell would have given ten years of his
life ungrudgingly to have had as many inches of steel in his belt.</p>

<p>‘’Od sake, man, ye can run as weel as fight!’ exclaimed a
familiar voice close to him, as the fugitive slackened speed to
collect his strength for the desperate struggle he anticipated.
‘Keep wast, hinny! keep wast! down yon burnie-side. I
can hear “Wanton Willie” nickerin’ at us the noo!’</p>

<p>Though they still kept on at a rapid pace, between running
and walking, Maxwell’s hand was fast locked in that of ‘Dick-o’-the-Cleugh,’
whilst the borderer, pointing to a neighbouring
brake in which a confederate, with two led horses, was concealed,
in a tone of suppressed triumph assured his friend
that he was safe.</p>

<p>It took but little time to mount ‘Wanton Willie,’ the
redoubtable bay that Dick affirmed was the pride of his lord’s
stable, and less to inform the borderer of the plot against Her
Majesty, and the necessity for reaching Perth with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
speed they could command. As they swung along at a hand-gallop,
Dick, with many a smothered laugh and quaint allusion,
for he looked on the whole performance, from first to last, as
an unparalleled jest, detailed to his companion the measures
he had adopted to effect his delivery.</p>

<p>Translated from his own vernacular, the borderer’s account
was as follows:&mdash;After his interview with the Queen and her
ladies in Edinburgh, he had ridden on to Leslie with the intention
of rescuing Walter with the strong hand; but on arriving
in Fife he found that country in so alarmed a state, and Leslie
House itself so securely watched and strongly garrisoned, that
such a project was utterly impracticable. His predatory habits
had taught Dick, long ago, that where force was useless, resort
must be had to stratagem, and he set about his task with all
the quiet energy of his character and the craft of his profession.</p>

<p>In the first place it was necessary to diminish his retinue,
in order to avoid suspicion. ‘Lang Willie’ and ‘Jock-o’-the-Hope’
accordingly were despatched back to Hermitage, leaving
one of their horses for the use of the prisoner, and Ralph
Armstrong, a sedate and cautious old jackman, remained at a
considerable distance from Leslie with the three horses,
which he kept well exercised, and fit for a trial of speed and
endurance at any moment.</p>

<p>Dick then disguising himself like a countryman, applied
for a day’s work or two in the gardens and pleasure-grounds
of Leslie, and ere long his great strength and inexhaustible
good-humour so won upon the gardener, that he was installed
as a regular labourer about the place. Here he soon made himself
acquainted with the passages and entrances of the stronghold,
more especially with the geography of the dungeon tower.
Nevertheless, study it as he would, he could find no means
of communicating with the captive, much less of liberating
him from thraldom. A thick iron door between massive stone
walls is no ineffectual barrier, if only it be kept locked.</p>

<p>Turning matters over and over in his own mind, while he
worked away in the flower-garden, Dick had arrived at the conclusion
that the shortest method would be to set the whole place
on fire, seize his keys, after braining old Ralph the jailer in the
confusion, and thus make his escape with the prisoner through
the flames. To his great relief he had long since ascertained,
amidst the gossip of the servants, that Maxwell was still alive.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, to choose a judicious moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
for this exploit, and Dick, understanding that the Lord Rothes
and a large force were to move on the Sabbath from Leslie,
had selected that day, when the house would be less strictly
guarded than usual, for his undertaking. His plan was to
fire the place about the hour of curfew, when the retainers
were sauntering abroad in the summer evening, and were less
easily collected than at any other hour; but as our borderer
was a man of great rapidity in action, and kept himself ready
at any moment to take an advantage, Armstrong had strict
directions whenever, by day or night, he should see a wreath
of smoke or a red glare above the old beeches, that instant
the horses should be brought to a certain secluded coppice
within half a mile of the castle.</p>

<p>Thus our friend laid his plans, and with equal judgment
disposed his combustibles, straw by straw, as it were, and
faggot by faggot, even as the bird of the air builds her nest,
with secrecy and perseverance. Everything was ready, and
the borderer went about his work in the garden, as he said to
himself, ‘with a clear conscience.’ On this very afternoon,
when Maxwell made his unaided escape from confinement,
Dick had just returned from attending the three noblemen to
their game at bowls&mdash;the very game which Maxwell had remarked
unfinished as he crossed the green. It was with no
small surprise that he saw the prisoner escaping across the
garden which was his own peculiar charge.</p>

<p>The borderer was somewhat disconcerted; nevertheless, he
reflected for a moment. ‘If,’ thought he, ‘Mr Maxwell can
surmount the outer wall he will but light down plump
amongst the three earls who are walking in the avenue
beyond; if he remain concealed here in the garden, he is sure
to be missed when old Ralph visits the prison, discovered,
and retaken; nay, if Rothes be the least out of humour, probably
put to death. The faggots are all laid: I have a flint
and steel in my belt; I had best set fire to the place at once,
and have done with it.’</p>

<p>Moreover, Dick was not very sure on his own account that
he might not be himself suspected. In getting the bowls
ready for the three noblemen, Moray’s piercing glance had
not failed to detect a face he seemed to recognise. With a
brief effort of memory the Earl recalled that thrust on the
causeway of Edinburgh from mad Arran’s blade, and the interposition
of Earl Bothwell’s henchman, which saved his own life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Good fellow,’ said he, as Dick raised his face from setting
‘the jack’ in its place, ‘I have seen you before; I owe you
a debt for saving my life a while ago, during a brawl in the
High Street.’</p>

<p>Argyle and Rothes were at the other end of the green,
poising their bowls to begin; Dick answered hastily, and in
a whisper&mdash;‘I’ve been in trouble on the border; I’m in
trouble yet; but I’m no kent in Fife. Your honour can best
pay it by no lettin’ on<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that ye’ve ever seen me before!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> “Lettin’ on,” Scottice for disclosing a secret.</p>

</div>

<p>Moray was a good-natured man enough; he nodded an
understanding, and put a piece of gold in the gardener’s hand;
but, nevertheless, Dick felt none the more sanguine, after this
recognition, for the success of his enterprise.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had he seen Maxwell swing himself
into the old beech tree, a gymnastic feat which called forth
his warmest approval, than he hastened back to put his long-laid
scheme in practice, with what success we have already
learned; for the bloodhound’s sagacity must unquestionably
have led to a discovery of the fugitive, had it not been for
the diversion occasioned by the fire.</p>

<p>‘An’ noo,’ said the borderer, with a sad, wistful expression
on his honest face, very different from the roguish humour
with which he had narrated the detail of his adventure,&mdash;‘an’
noo, I’m easy in my mind, whichever way the bowl may rin.
I’ve paid my debt, Maister Maxwell, ye ken; I’m thinking
it’ll no be lang or I get my quittance.’</p>

<p>Maxwell was somewhat puzzled; he could not quite fathom
the meaning of his honest friend. Alas! ere a few hours
were past he understood it but too well.</p>

<p>Time of course was the chief object with the three cavaliers;
it was indispensable to arrive in Perth at as early an
hour as possible, so as to warn the Queen of her danger, and
to raise the country for the punishment of her foes. The
party however were right well mounted; Dick had not
selected the <em>worst</em> of Bothwell’s horses for an expedition in
which speed was so likely to be an essential element of success;
and ‘Wanton Willie,’ once the property of Lord Scrope
himself, and stolen from the English warden by a series of
stratagems, remarkable alike for ingenuity and audacity, was
an animal of extraordinary power, mettle, and endurance.</p>

<p>It was no ordinary sensation of delight that Maxwell experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
as he swept through the evening air borne onwards
by the long untiring stride of the powerful bay stallion. It was
like grasping the hand of an old friend to stroke and smooth
that swelling crest as ‘Wanton Willie’ tossed his head and
snorted, champing the bit and snatching playfully at the rein.</p>

<p>He had always loved a good horse well. Now with the
fate of a kingdom dependent on his speed, he could not prize
too highly the merits of his charger. Also Maxwell’s heart
was even yet sore and empty; it was soothing to rely on the
honest fidelity of a brute. How many men are there who
lavish on horse and hound the affections that were hoarded,
it may be, long ago, elsewhere; given unreservedly, accepted
with glee, and returned after a while to the dejected owner
with the sap dried up, the core extracted, and the virtue
gone! So he learns to content himself perforce with that
which is real and substantial, at least as far as it goes; learns
to thrill at the note of a hound, forget the past in the glowing
excitement of a gallop; and the well-judging world opines
that he has a grovelling soul which soars not above the
stables and the kennel, and is fit for no better things.</p>

<p>The moon was coming up from the horizon, and still the
three rode swiftly and steadily on. They were many miles
from Leslie now, but, alas! they were not yet clear of
Leslie’s influence. At a small hamlet where they stopped to
water and refresh their horses, Maxwell was recognised ere
he touched the ground by a scion of the house of Rothes,
even then on the march with a party of horse to join his kinsman’s
forces at the Paren-Well.</p>

<p>David Leslie started with surprise as the bay was pulled up
at the stone trough before the village inn, but the young soldier
was prompt in action and saw at a glance he had but
three men to deal with, and one of those unarmed. His own
retainers were numerous and on the spot.</p>

<p>‘Walter Maxwell!’ he exclaimed, seizing ‘Wanton Willie’
at the same instant by the bridle, ‘you are my prisoner! Ho!
a Leslie! a Leslie! to the rescue!’</p>

<p>His men came pouring out at the well-known cry. Stout
troopers all of them, and armed besides to the teeth. There
was nothing for it but a quick and determined resistance.</p>

<p>Dick spurred his horse without hesitation against the assailant
on foot, dealing him at the same moment a heavy buffet
with his gauntleted hand, for he had no time to draw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
sword. Armstrong protected Maxwell’s other flank. There
were several fierce oaths, a pistol-shot, a smothered groan,
much trampling of hoofs, a plunge or two, and Maxwell found
himself again careering along between his two defenders over
the open plain at a pace that set pursuit at defiance.</p>

<p>‘Well out of that, Dick!’ said he cheerily, as they pulled
their horses at last into a trot, and listened for the enemy who
came not. ‘Well out of that! we’ll win the race and be
home now before midnight, I expect. These are rare stuff,
these Border nags of yours; it’s no wonder men should be
tempted to steal such cattle as we are riding to-night!’</p>

<p>But Dick answered nothing, only he seemed to hold his horse
in a rigid immovable grasp, and the three broke into a gallop
even swifter than before. The moon was up now, riding clear
and high in the mid-heaven. Was it only her light that made
the borderer’s face so pale? Dick spoke at last in a thick, hoarse
voice, and the others pulled up simultaneously as he did so.</p>

<p>‘I’ll light doun, I’m thinkin,’ said he. ‘Ride <em>you</em> on,
Maister Maxwell! I’ll just bide where I am awee. It’s a
kin’ o’ dwam<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>-like that’s come over me.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Dwam&mdash;a swoon.</p>

</div>

<p>He dismounted while he spoke. He was scarce clear of
the saddle ere he staggered and fell heavily to the ground.
Armstrong unbuckled his corslet and opened the buff jerkin
beneath. It was light enough for Maxwell to see the little
round mark that soldiers know so well. Large drops were
standing on the borderer’s forehead, and his lips were turning
white. Maxwell took his hand, and the dying man smiled a
feeble, ghastly smile, as he returned the grasp.</p>

<p>‘I’ll no win back to Liddesdale,’ said he, faintly. ‘I’ll no
get the length o’ Perth the nicht. I’ll be meat for the corbies<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the morn. Gude speed ye, my canny lad! Pit yer foot intill
the stirrup again. A Queen’s errans munna stan’ still for the
like o’ me!’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Corbies&mdash;crows.</p>

</div>

<p>Maxwell’s tears fell thick and fast. While Armstrong held
the horses, he propped the borderer’s head upon his knee, and
whispered a few broken words, he knew not what, of grief and
hope, that seemed a mockery even then.</p>

<p>The mossy turf on which they rested was not more clammy
than the pale forehead in its damps of death; he was bleeding
inwardly, and every breath he drew exhausted more and
more the shallow stream of vitality that was left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ride <em>you</em> on,’ he whispered, ‘ride <em>you</em> on! leave Ralph
wi’ <em>me</em>, I’ll no keep him lang. Ye’ll win to the Court the
morn, lad, an’ ye’ll see bonny Mistress Seton, an’ ye’ll tell
her frae me&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>He was getting very weak now; twice or thrice he strove
to speak, but no sound came. Maxwell bent over him, and
held his breath to catch the sacred accents of the dying man.</p>

<p>He raised himself a little with an effort, and his voice was
stronger now.</p>

<p>‘Tell her,’ said he, ‘that if ever she can win to Liddesdale,
she maun walk afoot through the bonny glens, and hearken
to the lilt of the lavrock, an’ pu’ a sprig o’ the red heather,
just to mind her o’ “Dick-o’-the-Cleugh”&mdash;rough, rantin’
Dick, that wadna ha’ evened himself to kiss the very ground
beneath her feet. Eh! lad, an’ she hadna been a born leddy,
I wad hae lo’ed yon lassie weel!’</p>

<p>Then Dick’s head sank lower and lower; nor, although he
lived for a short space afterwards, was he heard to speak again.
Maxwell was forced to leave him, however loth, in charge of his
comrade; his own duty would admit of no delay. Sadly and
slowly he mounted ‘Wanton Willie’ once more; sadly and
slowly he loitered away at a foot’s pace, turning his head often
to gaze wistfully back where Ralph Armstrong was stooping
in the moonlight over the long prostrate figure of the henchman.
At last he saw Ralph lay the head gently down upon the sward,
and walk a few paces away. Then he knew that it was over,
and galloped on towards Perth with wet eyes and a heavy heart.</p>

<p class="noindent">quoth Congreve, or one of the old dramatists. We may take our
choice of maxims on the important topic of wedlock, satisfied
that, ponder on it as we may, it is a matter in which blind fortune
concerns herself more than in any other of our human
affairs. Yes, ‘your marriage goes by destiny,’ no doubt, and
sometimes the fates draw you off nectar, and sometimes wholesome
bitters, and sometimes weak, insipid, flat, and stale small
beer. Under any circumstances it is better not to pull a wry face
at the draught. If the fairest woman the earth ever saw could not
make sure of conjugal happiness, who has a right to complain?</p>

<p>Darnley was now Duke of Albany&mdash;the handsomest Duke in
Christendom&mdash;and on the evening before her nuptials his affianced
bride had somewhat prematurely caused him to be proclaimed
King of Scotland. Two religions had prepared to consecrate
the tie; the Pope’s dispensation, inasmuch as the lovers
were blood relations, had been obtained from Rome, and the
banns by which, according to the Reformed Persuasion ‘Harry
Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross should be united to Mary, by
the grace of God, Queen of Scots, and Sovereign of the Realm,’
had been proclaimed in the Parish Church of the Canongate.</p>

<p>The Queen had escaped the plot laid against her by her
enemies at Leslie House, and, it is needless to say, how royal
favour and ladies’ smiles were showered upon the daring rider
who foundered ‘Wanton Willie’ for ever by the speed with
which he brought his timely intelligence to Perth, a speed
that enabled the Queen to sweep down to her capital with a
strong, well-mounted escort, in advance of all the preparations
made for her capture. She had quelled an insurrection at St
Leonard’s Craigs since then; she had strengthened her party
by all the means at her disposal, and even striven hard to
listen without anger to the ill-timed remonstrances of Elizabeth,
forwarded through Randolph, who, somewhat to his
dismay, and much, to his disgust, found his importance waning,
hour by hour, at the Scottish Court.</p>

<p>Everything a woman <em>could</em> do by persuasion, by policy, by
forbearance, by her own intrinsic fascination, Mary had done
to attain, if possible, a few months or even weeks of repose
for the enjoyment of the present; happy, as she fancied herself,
in her love, and willing to be at peace with all the world.</p>

<p>And while the young Queen looked about her for friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and partisans in every direction, was it likely that she would
forget her stout champion on the border, the warlike Earl of
Bothwell? It may be that she had long sought an excuse to
pardon him; it may be that, like the rest of her sex, though
prone to commit it in haste, her heart smote her sore, after
awhile, for an act of injustice. She recalled him, she forgave
him, she brought him back to her dangerous presence, and
the flame that was consuming this wild and tameless heart,
only burned all the fiercer that he must stifle it for awhile.</p>

<p>Moray kept aloof from the sister whom he had deceived,
and the Queen against whom he had conspired. Accustomed
as Mary had been for so long to depend upon her brother
whenever she needed counsel or assistance, no doubt she felt
his estrangement very keenly; but even Moray, notwithstanding
all his offences, she would have received once more with
open arms, had he abjured his devotion to the interests of the
astute Elizabeth, and returned to his natural duty and allegiance.</p>

<p>The fairest daughter of the Stuarts was always, alas! more
of the woman than the Queen. Had she been less frank, less
trusting, less kindly, less affectionate, above all, less beautiful,
the crown of Scotland would have sat more firm upon her
head, the head itself would not at last have been severed by
the cruel axe at Fotheringay.</p>

<p>But that dainty head never looked more nobly than to-day.
With the glory of love and happiness shining round it; with
the royal diadem resting on the white and gentle brow; with
the soft rich hair gathered into such a coronet of splendour as
no other princess, as no other <em>woman</em> in Europe, could boast;
with a majestic form set off by the sweeping robes of <em>black</em> in
which, as a royal widow, <i>étiquette</i> bade her approach the altar;
above all with the atmosphere of beauty that surrounded Mary
as with a charm, Old Thomas the Rhymer had never such a
vision of the Fairy Queen herself as burst upon the sight of
loyal Lennox and devoted Athol, when she emerged from her
chamber and suffered them to conduct her to the Chapel Royal
of Holyrood, at six of the clock on the summer Sabbath morning
that smiled with such well-omened brilliancy upon the bride.</p>

<p>Could black fate be hovering over that gay and sparkling
throng, marking them out, as it were, one by one, for her
future shafts? There they stood&mdash;so many of them; the
brave, the beautiful, the loyal, the gentle and the true, glowing
in youth and health, towering in the pride of manhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and the pride of place; radiant in silks and velvets, blazing
with gold and gems; and the red mark scored in the book of
destiny against two out of every three illustrious names, and
the little cloud, though still below the horizon, yet waiting
none the less surely to break in fatal tempest over the proud
unconscious brows, and shatter the guilty and the innocent in
one indiscriminate ruin to the dust.</p>

<p>Even crook-backed Riccio could not forbear an exultant
song of rejoicing when the ceremony was concluded, that gave
his indulgent mistress to the handsome, petulant boy she had
chosen for her lord.</p>

<p>‘Glory to God!’ exclaimed the secretary, in his deep, rich
tones, as the rites were finished with a burst of chanted
thanksgiving. How long was it ere those same lips, writhing
in their death-pang, were gasping for mercy in hoarse, gurgling
whispers choked in blood? In the meantime, the Queen is
conducted back from the Chapel to the Palace, and the ceremony
takes place of unrobing Her Majesty, who is now no
longer a widow, but a bride, with all the established jests and
noisy glee such an occasion is calculated to call forth.</p>

<p>First Darnley takes out a pin, then Athol, then Lennox, then
each of the gentlemen of the household as he can approach
the royal person, while her ladies like a guard of Amazons
close round her more and more as the spoliation proceeds.
The process, as is natural, soon degenerates into something
like a romp, and Walter Maxwell, with a heavy heart, finds
himself, to his own dismay, mixed up with such merry fooleries.</p>

<p>While Her Majesty proceeds with a few of her tiring-women
into another chamber, whence she will presently reappear
in dazzling apparel suited to the occasion, we will return
to the humbler personages of the scene, who may now, like
the supernumeraries in a theatre, come up to the foot-lights
and display their antics, whilst their betters are off the stage.</p>

<p>To begin with the Maries, whom we have too much neglected
whilst taken up with ruder and less engaging natures.</p>

<p>Those young ladies, by the very act to which they have
even now been lending their assistance, have become freed
from their self-imposed obligations of celibacy, and might
marry, if it so pleased them, one and all to-morrow. To the
philosopher who fancies he understands the nature of the sex, it
will not appear surprising that at this juncture none of them
should show the slightest disposition for entering that holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
state, from which it has hitherto been considered such an
extreme hardship they should be debarred. Hilarious, as it
was their duty to appear during the performance of Her
Majesty’s nuptials&mdash;hilarious, of course, be it understood,
with the proper admixture of tears&mdash;for ladies esteem a wedding
to be essentially an April performance of showers and
sunshine&mdash;yet no sooner was the principal excitement over,
no sooner were the four young beauties released from their
respective attitudes of attention, and at liberty to receive the
compliments and reply to the bantering congratulations of
the courtiers, than a cloud seemed to come over each of them,
and they looked far less inclined to laugh than to cry.</p>

<p>Mary Beton, perhaps, kept her spirits up with more determination
and a greater show of indifference than either of her
sisters in sorrow; nevertheless, Mary Beton, while she certainly
enjoyed an advantage over the others, was in an uncomfortable
state of uncertainty and transition.</p>

<p>Although it is doubtless a wise and wholesome precaution for a
lady to have two strings to her bow, yet the instrument is apt
to get somewhat warped and out of order in the process of taking
off the old and fitting on the new. There is something softening
as well as soothing in the attentions of the recent capture, and
they remind us rather touchingly at times of those other looks
and tones which made such fools of us not so long ago. We
cannot do the same things, say the same words, go through the
same exercises (and in truth there is, we believe, but little
variety in the drill by which the human heart is disciplined),
without experiencing very much the same kind of sensations
as heretofore, and it is not always easy to distinguish between
the old feelings and the new. The former come over us with
an overwhelming rush when we least expect them, and our only
chance is to credit the fresh account with as much of the balance
as we can. That same tenant-right is a very difficult matter to
get rid of when once it has been firmly established in the breast.</p>

<p>Mary Beton had broken with her old lover for good and
all. She had convicted him of treason to her Queen; and
although this offence she might possibly have forgiven,
she had found him out in treachery to herself. It is needless
to say that she would have nothing more to do with Randolph,
and was prepared to listen with no unwilling ear to
the suit of Alexander Ogilvy. But the latter was distant and
offended still. He had not forgotten certain rebuffs, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
black looks and cold answers, that had piqued and irritated
him long ago. He loved her indeed very dearly, therefore he
did not mean to hold out for any great length of time, but still
it was <em>his</em> turn now, and he could not be expected to forego his
share of advantage in the merciless game. It is an old saying
that ‘many a heart is caught on the rebound,’ and perhaps
he was sure of his prey, and content to wait a little and enjoy
the excitement of the capture.</p>

<p>Proud Mistress Beton, too, had become far more docile and
womanly of late. Pained and humbled by the treatment she
had experienced from Randolph, it would have been inexpressibly
soothing and delightful to encourage and return an attachment
she could trust, and on which she could lean, so to speak,
without fear of mortification. Great liberties are sometimes
taken, great risks run, in these affairs. Tempers that are imperturbable
on all other topics, blaze up with reckless violence
against the nearest and dearest. When the wild bird has ruffled
her plumes in anger, and broken her jesses in pique, the observant
fowler, who watches his opportunity, finds every facility
afforded for his lure. There is no time at which the human
heart is so susceptible to kindness as when writhing under a
sense of injustice and ill-treatment which it has not deserved.</p>

<p>So Mary Beton was less haughty, less overbearing, and
consequently looked ten times lovelier than usual on her mistress’s
wedding-day.</p>

<p>She stands now nearest the door, waiting for the Queen,
and whispers gently and lovingly to Mary Seton, who seems
to cling to her senior as to an elder sister, and whose fair face
has of late assumed a sad and thoughtful expression very
different from that which it used to wear.</p>

<p>The arch looks are downcast now, and the merry voice is
hushed and low. The girl is not unhappy, only grave and
saddened perhaps a little by her experiences. She has bid
Walter tell her over and over again how poor Dick Rutherford
laid him down to die in the moonlight and spoke of her&mdash;of
<em>her</em>, the vain, frivolous girl!&mdash;with the last breath he ever
drew. What had she done to win so entirely the devotion of
that great honest heart? Had she suspected it? Had she
triumphed in it? Had she prized it? Ah! never so much
as now, when all the wishing in the world would fail to bring
the trusting kindly nature back to her feet.</p>

<p>She was a noble damsel, and Dick but the mere retainer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of a warlike lord, ranking scarce above a man-at-arms. And
yet it was something, surely, to have been so loved by any
one human heart: to have taken everything and given nothing
in return. She could weep now to think that never&mdash;never
would she be able to make him amends.</p>

<p>Ay, he was a <em>man</em> that was brave and strong and single-minded,
daring, patient, resolute, fearing nothing under heaven,
humble and child-like only with <em>her</em>. How often might
she unwittingly have wrung the gentle, uncomplaining heart;
how often purposely, just to essay and feel her power! She
could hate herself to think of a hundred trifles now! Ah!
too late&mdash;too late! He was gone where neither foeman’s
lance nor lady’s look could reach; where cold words and bare
steel were alike powerless to wound. Gone&mdash;gone altogether,
and she would <em>never</em> see him more.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mary Seton, as she stood there and looked at
her comrades, that she alone would fulfil that vow of celibacy
from which to-day’s festival had enfranchised the Queen’s
Maries. Where could she expect to find hereafter such an
affection as she had neglected and lost? No; henceforth she
would devote herself heart and hand to the service of her mistress;
cling to the Queen through rain and shine, calm and
storm, good and evil. If prosperity blessed her dear mistress,
she would rejoice; if adversity frowned, she would console her;
if danger or calamity came, she would share it. Let the others
marry, an’ they must; for her, she would belong to her Queen!
And nobly, in after years, Mary Seton redeemed her vow.</p>

<p>But there was one of the maids-of-honour whose wedding
was indeed to succeed Her Majesty’s, who looked forward
to its arrival with more than maidenly longing; who hoped
for it, and relied on it with more than a woman’s trust.
Mary Hamilton, with her pale face and wasted form, had
continued her service with the Queen, silent and uncomplaining,
never unbosoming herself to her companions, not even
confiding her sorrows to her mistress until now. To-morrow
she would be free; to-morrow would be the day of her espousals,
and the poor weary head would lay itself to rest, the
poor sore heart find comfort and relief at last. It was for
this she had been waiting so patiently, for this she had borne
her burden so uncomplainingly. To-morrow she would become
the Bride of Heaven, and the veil she would then put
on must never be taken off again this side the grave!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>In her cell (so her religion taught her, hopeful even in
death), in her cell she could pray for the soul of him she had
loved so fondly; could believe, when his fiery sufferings and
her own prayers and tears had obliterated his crimes, she
would meet him, never again to part, on the shining hills beyond
the dark shadowy valley that she feared no whit, nay,
that she only longed to tread.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton took the vows on the day subsequent to
the Queen’s marriage, at the bright midsummer season, when
the blooming world should have looked fairest and most captivating
to her who turned her back upon it so willingly for
evermore. During a twelvemonth, so the Romish Church
enforced, she must make trial of her new profession, and at
the expiration of that period, should she continue in the same
mind, the novice was to become a nun.</p>

<p>There is little doubt she would have fulfilled her intention
had the occasion ever arrived.</p>

<p>It was an early harvest that year in Scotland, but ere the
barley was white, Mary Hamilton had done with nuns and
nunneries, vows and ceremonies, withered hopes and mortal
sorrows, and had gone to that place where the weary heart
can alone find the rest it had so longed for at last.</p>

<p>There is but one more of the Maries with whom we have to do:
Mistress Carmichael must speak for herself in another chapter.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps of the four young ladies who had thus devoted
themselves to the service of the Queen, Mary Carmichael
was the least changed in demeanour and outward
appearance at the auspicious period which gave them their freedom,
and entitled them to assume that temporary dominion
over the other sex which is a woman’s birthright. She was
still beautiful as ever; her sorrows, if she had any, did not
veil an atom of brilliancy in her eye, or take a shade of
colour from her cheek; her figure was no less rounded and
symmetrical in its full flowing lines, her step no less firm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
haughty, her manner, if anything, colder and more self-reliant.
If there was any change observable in Mary Carmichael, it
was that she seemed to become harder, prouder, less sympathising
and less womanly day by day.</p>

<p>On some natures anxiety and distress produce a bracing,
and as it were a petrifying effect; they will not have it
thought that they can be affected by such morbid influences
as the feelings. There are women of ice and women of fire,
women of wax and women of marble. It is possible that, if
the truth were known, these strong beauties suffer as much as
their more impressionable sisters, and yet the proud face
never falls, the hard eyes never soften. Try her with words
that ought to stab, each of them, to the quick; if she winces
you never know it, for the white bosom heaves no higher, the
colour neither fades nor deepens on the fair, provoking cheek.
It is maddening to the assailant; perhaps also the one attacked
is not quite so comfortable as she looks; perhaps if you
were to alter your tactics, to change your mood, and take up
the cool, indifferent line yourself, she might be goaded out of
this unnatural calm into a tempest that, if it did break out,
would probably be very terrible. It is better not to try.
‘Touch not the cat but a glove,’ says the motto of a noble
Scottish family; ‘Never drive a woman into a corner,’ is the
maxim of every philosopher who would escape scaithless
from those contests in which the rougher and honester nature
is almost sure to come by the worst.</p>

<p>Walter Maxwell was not the man to persevere in a wooing
that he once had reason to believe was unwelcome; he, too,
could hide a warm, loving heart, under a grave, impenetrable
brow&mdash;could bear the pain of seeing the idol of his fancy
day by day more and more estranged, yet never wince
nor writhe under the torture, far less upbraid or complain.
For weeks he had been habitually in her society, himself
the hero of the hour, the man whom the Queen favoured
as her deliverer, whom lords and ladies greeted as her
champion, yet never hazarded a word nor look that could lead
Mary Carmichael to believe he still cared for her, far less
sought an interview, as doubtless she often hoped he would,
that should bring about reproaches, tears, a quarrel, an explanation,
and a reconciliation.</p>

<p>These two proud dispositions were like the parallel lines
which, similar in all their properties, are for that reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
incapable of meeting. How the woman’s heart swelled and
ached when she watched him always so calm, so courteous, so
impassible, so indifferent; how she longed for him to be rude,
fierce, angry, even unjust and unreasonable! she would rather
he had <em>struck</em> her than thus passed her by with that studiously
gentle manner, that hateful iron smile. Oh! it was hard to
bear&mdash;hard to bear; and yet she <em>must</em> bear it, and none must
know her weakness or her sufferings.</p>

<p>And he, too, longing only to forgive everything in which he
felt himself aggrieved, believing he could be quite content
now if they were but <em>friends</em> and nothing more, thirsting for
one kind look from her eyes, one cordial word from her lips,
felt bound perforce to treat her with the calm, courteous,
defiant bearing of those who are enemies to the death.</p>

<p>Ludicrous as it might have been to the bystanders, it was
an uncomfortable state of things to the performers themselves
in the little drama,&mdash;tragedy, comedy, farce, call it what you
will, and your nomenclature will probably depend upon your
time of life: lovers’ quarrels look so different as the decades
roll by. An uncomfortable state of things, doubtless, and it
might have gone on for a lifetime but for one of those accidents
to which such sufferers are peculiarly susceptible.</p>

<p>Accidents, like the fresh breeze that springs up on a sultry
summer’s day. The heavens are dark and lowering, there is
an oppressive weight in the atmosphere, the very birds sit
hushed and sullen behind the motionless leaves, and the
earth looks saddened and weary, mourning as if she had made
up her mind that the sun was never to shine again. Suddenly
the breeze wakes up and comes laughing out of the west; the
clouds fly scattered before him, the young leaves flicker in the
golden sunshine, the birds burst forth in those joyous strains
which, to do them justice, they are ever ready to strike up on
the slightest provocation, and the whole landscape shines and
smiles and quivers in life and light once more.</p>

<p>When the Queen emerged from her tiring-room in the
magnificent apparel best befitting such a bride, another courtier,
in addition to the party that had thronged the Chapel, entered
the royal circle to tender his homage as in duty bound, and
congratulate Her Majesty on her nuptials.</p>

<p>This new arrival was a tall, handsome man of middle age,
perhaps a little past that delusive epoch, yet still bearing the
traces of considerable beauty of feature, and distinguished for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
peculiar fascination of manner and grace of bearing. He was
dressed, too, with the utmost splendour, and obviously in the
very latest fashion of the French Court. Several of the
Queen’s immediate attendants seemed to know him well, and
greeted him with a warm assumption of cordiality and interest,
although in the outer circle, so to speak, inquiring glances
were shot at the welcome stranger, and whispers of ‘Who is
he? who is he?’ passed unanswered from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>It was chiefly among the younger courtiers and those whose
rank did not entitle them to share the secret councils of Her
Majesty that this curiosity was observed to manifest itself.
Two or three of the seniors accosted him with obviously suppressed
warmth and mirthful looks that denoted a world of intelligence
only known to themselves, but Mary Carmichael’s eyes
rested on the distinguished stranger with an expression of the
utmost love and confidence those very expressive eyes could convey.
Had it not been for this, Maxwell might never have
remarked the late addition to the royal circle, so absent was he
and preoccupied, truth to say, so utterly weary and sick at
heart. Watching, however, as he had accustomed himself to
do, by stealth, the direction of his mistress’s glances, he could
not but be aware of the stranger’s presence, and it needed no
second look to satisfy him that this was the identical cavalier
whom he had seen that starlight night in the Abbey-garden,
whose face and figure he was not likely to forget should he
live for a hundred years. On that memorable occasion he
remembered to have experienced a vague and puzzling sensation
that he had met his rival before. To-day, in the Queen’s
presence-chamber, it came back again; but he was in no mood
now to speculate on such random fancies and probabilities.</p>

<p>No, in five seconds of time he had made up his mind to the
worst, and had resolved upon the line of conduct he should adopt.</p>

<p>Of course it was all over at last. Never till this moment,
when it crumbled and fell to ashes, had he been aware how
much of hope there was mingled with his suspicions and his
pique. Hope! the word itself seemed an absurdity now.
Nevertheless, there is no such utter composure as a brave
mind borrows from the total annihilation of all it has loved
and cherished most. Men <em>can</em> have no anxieties when there is
nothing left to lose, and even a coward will sometimes die gracefully
enough if there be an obvious impossibility of escape.</p>

<p>The most accomplished gallant of the French Court could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
not have moved through the circle of ladies that crowded the
Queen’s ante-room with a more assured air than did Walter
Maxwell; the most consummate fop could not have shown
less agitation than was betrayed in the few words he addressed
then and there to Mistress Carmichael.</p>

<p>‘We were old friends once,’ said he, ‘though now we
seldom even speak. Shall I find you in the gallery before the
banquet. I should like to be friends again once for all.’</p>

<p>He might have been criticising the pattern of her dress, so
cold and quiet were his tones. The lady did not show quite
so much self-command. She turned very pale, and her lip
trembled so that she did not dare trust her voice; but she
bowed her head in the affirmative, and was glad to screen
herself from observation meanwhile amongst the ample dresses
of her companions.</p>

<p>You see she had by no means made up her mind that all
<em>was</em> over; perhaps, too, a horrible misgiving came across her
that she might have driven him too far.</p>

<p>While the rest of the household were preparing for the
banquet, they had the gallery to themselves. Strange to say,
the lady reached the trysting-place first. Though the colour
deepened on her cheek when she heard his step, she never
turned her head till he came close to her, and by that time
she had recovered her self-command. They were standing on
the very spot where she had dropped the roses long ago. If
this coincidence occurred to her, be sure she did not think it
worth while to mention it.</p>

<p>He spoke first, very gravely and kindly, in the tone of a
man who feels he has a reparation to make.</p>

<p>‘Mistress Carmichael,’ said he, ‘I have treated you unfairly
and unlike a friend. I may have thought I had a
right to be angry with you; now I know for certain that is
all over. I am no longer angry. I ask you to forgive me,
and to shake hands before we part.’</p>

<p>She scarcely dared look at him, standing there tall and
manly before her, with his kind eyes, and bold, frank brow.
No fopling lover to be given up lightly and at a moment’s
notice, forsooth? Over, was it? Perhaps she did not see it
at all in that light!</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ she gasped, trying hard not to
tremble, nor to laugh, nor indeed to cry.</p>

<p>‘I am reconciled to it all,’ was his answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span> ‘because I see
you love him, and that you are happy. It is but a selfish
affection that cannot rejoice in the welfare of its object. To-day,’
he added, with rather a sad smile, ‘the maiden’s vow is
at an end. Never mind what follies may have once crossed
my brain. Prove to me that you forgive them by confiding
in me as if I was your brother.’</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a quick, searching glance.</p>

<p>‘You mean you think I am going to be married?’ said she,
‘and you are wishing me joy?’</p>

<p>‘I am indeed,’ he replied, with another smile yet sadder
than the last. ‘Somewhat awkwardly, I fear, yet none the
less honestly for that. Listen! I shall never tell you so
again. I loved you as dearly as it is possible for man to love
woman; so dearly that even now I can rejoice that you are
happy. I can give you up to one you love. I can ask you
now at this moment, when everything is at an end between
us except friendship, the purest and most loyal, to let me
serve you all my life; though it will be years before I shall
have courage to look on your face again.’</p>

<p>The last sentence came out in spite of him. It spoke
volumes to a woman’s perceptions. Perhaps she liked that
involuntary confession of weakness better than all the strength
and self-denial she had so admired a while ago.</p>

<p>‘You do <em>really</em> love me,’ said she, trembling indeed still,
but pale no longer, ‘so well, that for my happiness you would
give up everything, even myself?’</p>

<p>‘Had it not been so,’ he answered, ‘do you think I should
have been so angry with you for what I saw in the Abbey-garden?
Well, he may claim you now before them all.
God bless you and <em>him</em>! Farewell! Will you not give me
your hand once more for the last time?’</p>

<p>She must have been a strangely unfeeling lady, Mistress
Mary Carmichael, to resist such an appeal, and yet the tears
were brimming in her eyes despite of a roguish, happy smile
on her red lips. She withheld her hand, however. Perhaps
she did not wish to part quite so abruptly.</p>

<p>‘You are generous,’ said she, between tears and laughter,
‘and you used to be obedient&mdash;at least sometimes. Wilful
always, you know, or I should not have had to chide you so
often. Will you shake my&mdash;my future husband by the hand,
and assure him of your good-will?’</p>

<p>He thought she might have spared him this, but he assented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
cordially. What mattered it, a little suffering, more or less?
At least it would put off the parting for a few minutes.</p>

<p>‘Wait here an instant while I bring him!’ said she, and
darted off, leaving Walter in that frame of mind which is best
described by the metaphor of ‘not knowing whether he stood
on his head or his heels.’</p>

<p>He had not long to wait, though in truth he kept no
account of time. A light hurrying footstep trod the gallery
once more, followed by a heavier and manlier stride. Maxwell
turned round to confront his lost love, closely followed
by the individual she had promised to bring.</p>

<p>’Tis strange how a vague, misty idea, that has puzzled us for
long, will sometimes shine out on a sudden as clear as day.
There was a frank, joyous expression on the stranger’s brow,
a sparkle of excitement in his eye, that brought back to Maxwell’s
recollection for the first time where he had seen him before
the well-remembered night in the Abbey-garden. It was
the same tall cavalier who had spurred his horse so gallantly into
the skirmish near Hermitage, shouting his war-cry the while.
It was a kinsman, then, whom she was going to marry after all.</p>

<p>Mary Carmichael stood silent for an instant looking from
one to the other. Then she spoke out very quick, as if anxious
to tell her story while she could.</p>

<p>‘Farewell, Master Maxwell! farewell, if indeed you mean
to leave us all at such short notice. You shall not go, however
without knowing my father, my dear father, who has
never dared show himself openly in Scotland till to-day.
And none of you ever found him out&mdash;not even you, with
your sharp, suspicious eyes,’ here she began to laugh; ‘and&mdash;and&mdash;<em>Walter</em>,
if I have seemed unkind to you, I am sorry for
it now,’ here she began to cry, ‘and I hope you will forgive
me, and love my father as well as I do. My dear, dear
father, who has got home safe at last!’</p>

<p>And then she flung herself on the paternal breast and hid
her face there, laughing and crying together, in a strange,
wild mood, very unlike the proud, self-reliant Mary Carmichael
whose tears Walter had so often wished he had the power to
call forth, if only for the pleasure of drying them; but then
these natures, like frozen streams melting in the sun, are proof
against everything but the warmth of a great happiness.</p>

<p>Sir Patrick Carmichael, for such was the name of Mary’s
adventurous father, had probably some inkling of how matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
stood. Whether she had explained to him that she had a
slight regard for this loyal servant of the Queen, or whether, as
is more likely, she had confined herself to talking of him on all
occasions, and constantly finding fault with him most unjustly
rather than not mention his name, is matter for conjecture; but
Sir Patrick, grasping Maxwell warmly by the hand, assured him
of his own good feelings towards him, and his sincere respect
for so brave and devoted an adherent of their Sovereign.</p>

<p>It was this latter quality that had won its way so triumphantly
into Sir Patrick’s heart. A staunch Catholic
himself, Walter Maxwell was probably the only Protestant
in Scotland to whom he would have intrusted the happiness
of his daughter, but the stout Queen’s-man was only bigoted
in his loyalty, and he could have refused nothing to the man
who saved Mary Stuart from the treachery of her intriguing
brother, and the violence of her own subjects.</p>

<p>He had himself been carrying on a secret correspondence
with the Guises on the part of his Sovereign for years, a
correspondence that involved continual disguises and many
hair-breadth ’scapes from the emissaries of those unscrupulous
statesmen, who would not have hesitated for an instant to
take his life. Such an exploit as the attempt to rob Randolph
of his dispatches was but an amusing interlude in a career like
his, but it was seldom indeed Sir Patrick could enjoy a ride,
either for sport or strife, in the society of his own countrymen.</p>

<p>His daily existence was one of imminent peril, only warded
off by constant vigilance and acuteness: his only pleasures,
and even these were subservient to political purposes, the
stolen visits to his daughter, which had so excited Maxwell’s
jealousy and distrust. He was a bold, nay, a reckless man
enough, but he loved that daughter in the corner of his fearless
heart better than anything on earth, <em>except</em> the cause of
his Queen; also, Sir Patrick was a person of delicacy and
kind feeling withal, owning that sympathy for a love affair
which those cannot but entertain who have themselves passed,
more or less scorched, through the fire.</p>

<p>So he left his daughter and Maxwell together in the gallery,
and when they all met at the Queen’s table an hour afterwards,
he observed that the pair never exchanged a word,
but looked as if they had some mutual understanding nevertheless,
and were so happy they could neither eat, nor drink,
nor converse rationally, nor sit still.</p>

<p>So the Maries were disposed of at last. The roses were unbound
from the chaplet and set free. Two of the flowers
bloomed happy and beautiful on the manly breasts in which
they had not spared on occasion to drive their thorns; one
clung obstinately to the person of her Queen; and one, perhaps
not the least fragrant and fair of the posy, drooped in a
cloister, and so withered untimely away.</p>

<p>Mary Hamilton went peacefully to her rest. Mary Seton
vowed eternal constancy to her Sovereign, and wished for
nothing better than to live and die a maiden in the Queen’s
service. Mary Beton took her loyal soldier at last, and made
him amends, doubtless, for the pains he had inflicted during
his probation. Randolph, a little disgusted and a good deal
amused, drank a posset to the health of the newly-wedded
pair, and even addressed a neatly-turned compliment to the
bride, which met with a colder reception that its ingenuity
deserved; but then the diplomatist consoled himself by reflecting
that a continuance of his attentions to ‘worthy
Mistress Beton,’ as he called her, would be a sad waste of
time when she ceased to furnish him with the intelligence he
required; and as for marrying her himself, why that of course
was out of the question. Ambition is a bride who brooks
no rival, and, in good truth, her worshippers cannot have too
few ties connecting them with their kind, for they must turn
their hands to strange jobs on occasion. Altogether he was
well satisfied to see her so comfortably disposed; for Randolph,
as has already been stated, was a good-natured man.</p>

<p>Having got over all their differences before marriage, Walter
Maxwell and his Mary quarrelled but little after that welcome
event. Tried, as their affection had been, in the fire,
and proved through so many years of anxiety, sorrow, and
estrangement, it would have been unreasonable to doubt it,
and madness indeed to hazard such a treasure for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
a light word or a moment’s discontent. So they went on
caring for each other as fondly, though not so uncomfortably,
as before. Neither of them were people to make much demonstration
of their feelings, but a calm happiness of repose
to which it had long been a stranger seemed to have settled
on the husband’s brow, and the love-light still shown soft and
lambent in the wife’s blue eyes when they turned upon the
man she had trusted so long and so feared to lose at last.</p>

<p>Their time, too, was fully occupied. Plenty to do at home;
troubles and strife and stirring news day by day abroad;
constant anxiety for the beloved mistress, whom they were
still prepared to serve with zealous loyalty; and no small
share of ill-will to sustain from the many disaffected and intriguing,
who were never quiet for a day throughout the
length and breadth of the land. Nevertheless, of all the
Maries, perhaps Walter Maxwell’s bride flourished the happiest
and the best-cared for of the blooming cluster.</p>

<p>But what of the Queen of the Roses, the Mary of Maries,
the noblest princess in Europe, the loveliest woman in the
world? Alas for the fairest flower in the garden! rain or
shine, storm or calm, there was to be no domestic peace, no
permanent repose for her. The man who should have tended
and cherished her to the death, proved but a selfish profligate,
and left her to pine and languish, weary, sorrowing, and
alone. The man who would once have shed his heart’s blood
freely to shield her from the slightest injury, goaded into
madness, ere long snatched wildly at her beauty, soiling her
petals with unknightly hand, and dragging the beloved one
with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust.</p>

<p>Yet still the stately flower bloomed on, fair and fragrant
under the pure air of heaven, fair and fragrant in the close
confinement and the darkened daylight of a prison-house.</p>

<p>But the storm was brewing the while low down in the
southern sky; the storm that was about to gather so dark
and pitiless, to burst at last in its fury over the Queen of the
Roses, and lay that lovely head upon the cold earth, beautiful
and majestic even in the pale agony of death.</p>
